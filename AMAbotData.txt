The feeling that made him flee returned, causing every nerve to spark at once, a Manhattan rush hour of neurochemicals.  There were so many reasons why he walked away from the girl.  In his limited state of cognitive ability, he tried to think of one that truly justified his actions.  He settled on the oldest.  That he, unlike everyone else, had been dying from the second he was born.  He had about three years left.  In exchange for his rapidly decelerating life span, he had some other gifts.  But who doesn’t, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A feeling of loss entered his being.  He could actually feel the energy he pulled from the world.  It entered the disturbed vortex of his being, swirling around indefinitely until it dissipated or was released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He saw the Kinko’s that he hated oh so much; but that wasn’t actually true. He loved the place.  Well, he loved to torment the place.  He slowly stalked nearer, gently feeling the energy it exuded.  He moved even closer and the store dimmed, the energy diverted to his being.  Conner played the game for five minutes.  The employee frantically pushed buttons as paper shot from copiers that were being turned on and off in rapid succession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laughing, he turned to head home.  Medicine, he thought, what a joke, claiming to be an esoteric discipline.  It’s my body.  I should know it best.  For years, doctors had postulated diagnoses and cures to his condition, unsuccessfully of course.  Their methods crack me up.  Especially the part where they prescribe a placebo and observe that the individual heals oneself.  Why do you need medicine when you can heal yourself?  Yet, even his iconoclastic tendencies did nothing to help him conquer one of his own diseases, self-doubt.  After all, it’s easier to attack institutions then believe in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being in a sorority was not at all what Sophie expected.  After joining, she was introduced to everyone.  Being a beautiful woman, she was one of the best advertisements for Alpha Gamma Iota, a trophy of sorts.  She loathed what she had become.  Sophie was clever though.  Knowing it would be impossible to live hating herself, she projected her discontent on to the external world.  Nothing escaped her scorn and tonight it was the guests of the party.  Faceless people, she thought, all coming and going, pretending to be real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walked out of the ‘Delt’ house; two unrelated twins followed her, their outfits mimicking each other’s.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You really shouldn’t walk home alone.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Trust me, I’ll be fine,” Her back turned, ending the conversation.  Sophie was a tough woman.  Her father insisted that each of his children be a confident, assertive, and well-rounded individual.  Therefore, when Sophie turned three, he found a satisfactory martial arts teacher and enrolled her in private lessons.  That was eighteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She glanced up at the moon.  For some reason it always provided solace, a steadying influence in her life.  She heard footsteps.  The twins were still behind her.  She turned to face them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why the fuck are you still following me?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to make sure you made it home safely.” One of the faux twins said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Bullshit.  Turn around and walk away.  Now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two closest links to Cro-Magnon man looked at each other, smiled, and continued to approach.  What have I gotten myself into?  It’s going to be four hundred pounds versus one fifteen.  Sophie took a deep breath, centering herself as the two neared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner lit a Parliament Light as he walked out of the house, whose, he wasn’t sure.  It was a party night and after watching the masses of men and women indiscriminately hook-up for the past two hours, he was exhausted or appalled, which he wasn’t sure.  He took a long drag and looked at the subtle, gentle curves of the moon.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being an astute, insightful, twenty-year-old philosophy student, along with having a life shortening disease, was not good on his psyche.  In fact, it cast him into the murky depths of nihilism.  A couple passed him, laughing.  Scorn twisted his face.  Jealousy tore his heart.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He breathed deeply, repressing his hatred of relationships, and continued down the street.  This life was very hard on Conner.  Isolation is a brutal thing, and it had jaded him deeply.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner glanced up at a streetlight, which proceeded to flicker and then go off.  Jesus, he thought, drifting into memory.  His first kung-fu teacher in San Francisco was the one who noticed his problem.  Master Chen asked his adoptive parents to come for a meeting.  He said, “Conner has a most unique problem.  His life force seems to constantly be pulling energy from everyone and everything.  It has had a negative influence on the rest of the students.  I will have to teach him privately.”  That statement, along with his parents’ insistence to consult the medical world, began the years of tests.  The light stirred to life as Conner turned the corner.  “Figures,” he said, turning his back to the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Sophie, baby, you got to stop leading guys on.”  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sophie spun around to look at her friend Sylvia.  “Leading them on?  I just said, hi.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I am worried about you.  All the girls say that the guys don’t like you cause you never deliver.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s interesting,” Sophie said.  I don’t deliver?  What the fuck is that?  There isn’t one guy in this frat I would deliver too.  “Sylvia, when I talk to a guy, I am doing just that, talking.  I can’t help it if the guy wants me.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Just be careful.  Sometimes drunk males have a tendency to misinterpret anything a woman says.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I promise to be on my best behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sylvia pulled out a Virginia Slim, lit it and pointed at two guys who could have been brothers, maybe even twins.  “What about those two?”  The guys turned, saw Sylvia pointing at them and started to walk over.  “Oh shit, I was pointing not beckoning.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Good work Sylv.  Misinterpretation example number one.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Heh ladies, you both look beautiful tonight.”  One of the two said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Thanks,” Sylvia turned to Sophie.  “I have to find Mary.  I’ll be back in five minutes,” she walked away before Sophie could respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re Sophie, right?”  Sophie smiled and nodded.  “Thought so.  Everyone said you’re the hottest girl here.  Someone also said that you know how to fight.  Me and my brother here wanted to know if you’d wanna take us on sometime?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“So you two wanna go a couple rounds with me, double team style?”  Sophie said flashing a devious smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah,” the guys said rubbing their hands together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sophie turned, laughing hysterically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner rounded the corner.  He saw a woman being followed by two men.  Her stride entranced him.  It was like his, slow yet confident, proud yet angry.  He couldn’t stop looking at her.  This snake charmer was dressed in a long khaki skirt with slits up both sides, a white long sleeve collared shirt and red cowboy boots.  Her blond hair shimmered in the electric glow of the streetlights. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having nowhere else to be, Conner followed.   The girl turned aggressively to the two dorks following her as Conner watched.  She was telling them off.  What a chick, he thought, bringing his walk to a trot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner felt a mystic connection.  Knowing that analyzing the situation would be of little benefit he performed the antithesis, forming a synthetic belief.  This girl is perfect.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sophie assumed her fighting stance, while quietly thanking her sensei for teaching her to never wear clothes too restricting to fight in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“So what, you guys gonna rape me right here.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The streetlight overhead flickered off, the ensemble’s eyes drawn to it.  “The gods must think it’s a good idea.  They made it darker for us,” one of the two said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You know I’m going to call the police.  I can identify you.  You’ll be caught.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two men laughed maniacally.  “Don’t you know at this university, there has only been one reported rape in the past four years?  Plus, we’re athletes; we get special favors from the police.  I don’t think we have anything to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Then come get it boys…”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       ` \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, Conner thought, this chick is hard-core.  Conner had come to a stop a few scant feet from the action.  Partially obscured by a tree and the lack of light, he had a perfect observation point.  Initially, Conner thought he’d have to intervene, but the chick was holding her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thug tried to grab her but she used an aikido move Conner recognized to throw him to the ground.  The other tried to punch her but she deflected the blow past her while stepping forward and kneeing him in the stomach.  An elbow to the small of the back introduced that twin to the maitre’ de of the cement lounge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner laughed to himself.  Women don’t realize how sexy it is when they can fight.  The first guy grabbed and yanked her legs, knocking Sophie to the ground.  Time to join in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first half of the fight went all right.  She had, of course, caught them off-guard, after all in today&amp;#39;s world, who really believes a woman can fight.  But, unfortunately, the male physique was too resilient and Sophie a bit overconfident.  She found herself on the ground as the two rose.  She looked up at her attackers dazed, her vision rendering them as swaying camels from the connection of her head with the cement.  They started toward her again.  Suddenly, her breath was painfully stolen.  Seconds later, a shadow appeared between her and the twins.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her breathing returned to normal yet an intense, indescribable feeling gripped her entire being.  It wasn’t pain, joy, fear, arousal, excitement, pleasure, but an amalgamation of all.  As her eyes regained the proper blood flow her vision improved and the shadow started to show its true characteristics.  It’s a guy, about seven four, she thought.  Wait, I’m looking up on him, that’s not right.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner darted out of the shadows attacking.  Fighting drunks is so easy, he thought, slowly dodging punches.  He had faced much worthier opponents on much darker streets in much darker towns.  A quick combination of three punches landed to one of the guys.  That twin crumpled as the final punch impacted with his neck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other guy attacked frenetically.  Huh, Conner thought disappearing between the twin’s searching punches, I wonder if I should let her finish him off.  Nah.  Conner eluded two more punches, turned his shoulder, focused his energy and struck.  His double palm strike sent the guy flying straight back, landing five feet from where Conner was standing; his arms extended from the massive amount of energy transferred.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conner’s system refreshed its depleted energy supply as he walked to both guys and put his Zippo in front of their mouths.  It fogged up on both.  Still breathing, that’s good.  Conner turned, the woman had stood but the glazed eyes remained.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear terrorized his head as the adrenaline left his body.  Standing in front of him was a stunningly beautiful woman who, for some reason, he felt a cosmic draw.  She was walking toward him.  Oh shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                       `\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sophie looked at the two bruised fraternity brothers sleeping peacefully on their cement bed.  The shadow was a real person.  My protector, my knight in shining armor.  Yeah right, she thought, I bet he thinks he deserves a reward for saving me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Are you all right?”  The man asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She reached down and took both of the guy’s wallets.  “Yeah,” she kicked one in the stomach, “I’m much better now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Touching,” the voice said as she turned to face it.  The street light overhead stirred back to life, blinding her.  Her hand shot up, shielding her eyes as she haphazardly scanned the perimeter trying to locate the voice in the time-space continuum.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank-you,” she said trying to bait an answer.  Who does this guy think he is?  Disappearing on me like that, I could have been hurt.  Her legs started moving, the houses disappearing in a blur.  Why am I running?  She stopped at the next street.  Nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sat on the curb and pulled out her pack of Parliament Lights when her eyes were drawn down the road.  A streetlamp had gone out.  She squinted, noticing a figure walk past it.  The lamp turned back on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huh, she thought, watching the figure intently, that’s interesting.  Once again, she found herself running without willing her body to do so.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"In this post: \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k067x/could_i_destroy_the_entire_roman_empire_during/c2giwm4?sort=old\n\na redditor asked a question that allowed him to write a story and create a massive groundswell of interest through AskReddit.

The employee frantically pushed buttons as paper shot from copiers that were being turned on and off in rapid succession.\n\n  Laughing, he turned to head home.  Medicine, he thought, what a joke, claiming to be an esoteric discipline.  It’s my body.  I should know it best.  For years, doctors had postulated diagnoses and cures to his condition, unsuccessfully of course.  Their methods crack me up.  Especially the part where they prescribe a placebo and observe that the individual heals oneself.  Why do you need medicine when you can heal yourself?  Yet, even his iconoclastic tendencies did nothing to help him conquer one of his own diseases, self-doubt.  After all, it’s easier to attack institutions then believe in yourself.\n\n                                           `\n\n  Being in a sorority was not at all what Sophie expected.  After joining, she was introduced to everyone.  Being a beautiful woman, she was one of the best advertisements for Alpha Gamma Iota, a trophy of sorts.  She loathed what she had become.  Sophie was clever though.  Knowing it would be impossible to live hating herself, she projected her discontent on to the external world.  Nothing escaped her scorn and tonight it was the guests of the party.  Faceless people, she thought, all coming and going, pretending to be real.\n\n  She walked out of the ‘Delt’ house; two unrelated twins followed her, their outfits mimicking each other’s.  \n\n  “You really shouldn’t walk home alone.”\n\n  “Trust me, I’ll be fine,” Her back turned, ending the conversation.  Sophie was a tough woman.  Her father insisted that each of his children be a confident, assertive, and well-rounded individual.  Therefore, when Sophie turned three, he found a satisfactory martial arts teacher and enrolled her in private lessons.  That was eighteen years ago.\n\n  She glanced up at the moon.  For some reason it always provided solace, a steadying influence in her life.  She heard footsteps.  The twins were still behind her.  She turned to face them.\n\n  “Why the fuck are you still following me?”\n\n  “We wanted to make sure you made it home safely.” One of the faux twins said.\n\n  “Bullshit.  Turn around and walk away.  Now.”\n\n  The two closest links to Cro-Magnon man looked at each other, smiled, and continued to approach.  What have I gotten myself into?  It’s going to be four hundred pounds versus one fifteen.  Sophie took a deep breath, centering herself as the two neared.\n\n                                           `\n\n  Conner lit a Parliament Light as he walked out of the house, whose, he wasn’t sure.  It was a party night and after watching the masses of men and women indiscriminately hook-up for the past two hours, he was exhausted or appalled, which he wasn’t sure.  He took a long drag and looked at the subtle, gentle curves of the moon.   \n\n  Being an astute, insightful, twenty-year-old philosophy student, along with having a life shortening disease, was not good on his psyche.  In fact, it cast him into the murky depths of nihilism.  A couple passed him, laughing.  Scorn twisted his face.  Jealousy tore his heart.  \n\n  He breathed deeply, repressing his hatred of relationships, and continued down the street.  This life was very hard on Conner.  Isolation is a brutal thing, and it had jaded him deeply.  \n\n  Conner glanced up at a streetlight, which proceeded to flicker and then go off.  Jesus, he thought, drifting into memory.  His first kung-fu teacher in San Francisco was the one who noticed his problem.  Master Chen asked his adoptive parents to come for a meeting.  He said, “Conner has a most unique problem.  His life force seems to constantly be pulling energy from everyone and everything.  It has had a negative influence on the rest of the students.  I will have to teach him privately.”  That statement, along with his parents’ insistence to consult the medical world, began the years of tests.  The light stirred to life as Conner turned the corner.  “Figures,” he said, turning his back to the light.\n\n                                           `\n\n  “Sophie, baby, you got to stop leading guys on.”  \n\n  Sophie spun around to look at her friend Sylvia.  “Leading them on?  I just said, hi.\"\n\n  “I am worried about you.  All the girls say that the guys don’t like you cause you never deliver.”\n\n  “That’s interesting,” Sophie said.  I don’t deliver?  What the fuck is that?  There isn’t one guy in this frat I would deliver too.  “Sylvia, when I talk to a guy, I am doing just that, talking.  I can’t help it if the guy wants me.”\n\n  “Just be careful.  Sometimes drunk males have a tendency to misinterpret anything a woman says.”\n\n  “I promise to be on my best behavior.”\n\n  Sylvia pulled out a Virginia Slim, lit it and pointed at two guys who could have been brothers, maybe even twins.  “What about those two?”  The guys turned, saw Sylvia pointing at them and started to walk over.  “Oh shit, I was pointing not beckoning.”\n\n  “Good work Sylv.  Misinterpretation example number one.”\n\n  “Heh ladies, you both look beautiful tonight.”  One of the two said.\n\n  “Thanks,” Sylvia turned to Sophie.  “I have to find Mary.  I’ll be back in five minutes,” she walked away before Sophie could respond.\n\n  “You’re Sophie, right?”  Sophie smiled and nodded.  “Thought so.  Everyone said you’re the hottest girl here.  Someone also said that you know how to fight.  Me and my brother here wanted to know if you’d wanna take us on sometime?”\n\n  “So you two wanna go a couple rounds with me, double team style?”  Sophie said flashing a devious smile.\n\n  “Oh yeah,” the guys said rubbing their hands together.\n\n  Sophie turned, laughing hysterically.\n\n                                           `\n\n  Conner rounded the corner.  He saw a woman being followed by two men.  Her stride entranced him.  It was like his, slow yet confident, proud yet angry.  He couldn’t stop looking at her.  This snake charmer was dressed in a long khaki skirt with slits up both sides, a white long sleeve collared shirt and red cowboy boots.  Her blond hair shimmered in the electric glow of the streetlights. \n\n  Having nowhere else to be, Conner followed.   The girl turned aggressively to the two dorks following her as Conner watched.  She was telling them off.  What a chick, he thought, bringing his walk to a trot.\n\n  Conner felt a mystic connection.  Knowing that analyzing the situation would be of little benefit he performed the antithesis, forming a synthetic belief.  This girl is perfect.  \n\n                                           `\n\n  Sophie assumed her fighting stance, while quietly thanking her sensei for teaching her to never wear clothes too restricting to fight in.\n\n  “So what, you guys gonna rape me right here.”\n\n  The streetlight overhead flickered off, the ensemble’s eyes drawn to it.  “The gods must think it’s a good idea.  They made it darker for us,” one of the two said.\n\n  “You know I’m going to call the police.  I can identify you.  You’ll be caught.”\n\n  The two men laughed maniacally.  “Don’t you know at this university, there has only been one reported rape in the past four years?  Plus, we’re athletes; we get special favors from the police.  I don’t think we have anything to worry about.”\n\n  “Then come get it boys…”\n\n                                           ` \n\n  Holy shit, Conner thought, this chick is hard-core.  Conner had come to a stop a few scant feet from the action.  Partially obscured by a tree and the lack of light, he had a perfect observation point.  Initially, Conner thought he’d have to intervene, but the chick was holding her own.\n\n  The first thug tried to grab her but she used an aikido move Conner recognized to throw him to the ground.  The other tried to punch her but she deflected the blow past her while stepping forward and kneeing him in the stomach.  An elbow to the small of the back introduced that twin to the maitre’ de of the cement lounge.\n\n  Conner laughed to himself.  Women don’t realize how sexy it is when they can fight.  The first guy grabbed and yanked her legs, knocking Sophie to the ground.  Time to join in.\n\n                                           `\n\n  The first half of the fight went all right.  She had, of course, caught them off-guard, after all in today's world, who really believes a woman can fight.  But, unfortunately, the male physique was too resilient and Sophie a bit overconfident.  She found herself on the ground as the two rose.  She looked up at her attackers dazed, her vision rendering them as swaying camels from the connection of her head with the cement.  They started toward her again.  Suddenly, her breath was painfully stolen.  Seconds later, a shadow appeared between her and the twins.  \n\n  Her breathing returned to normal yet an intense, indescribable feeling gripped her entire being.  It wasn’t pain, joy, fear, arousal, excitement, pleasure, but an amalgamation of all.  As her eyes regained the proper blood flow her vision improved and the shadow started to show its true characteristics.  It’s a guy, about seven four, she thought.  Wait, I’m looking up on him, that’s not right.  \n\n                                           `\n\n  Conner darted out of the shadows attacking.  Fighting drunks is so easy, he thought, slowly dodging punches.  He had faced much worthier opponents on much darker streets in much darker towns.  A quick combination of three punches landed to one of the guys.  That twin crumpled as the final punch impacted with his neck.  \n\n  The other guy attacked frenetically.  Huh, Conner thought disappearing between the twin’s searching punches, I wonder if I should let her finish him off.  Nah.  Conner eluded two more punches, turned his shoulder, focused his energy and struck.  His double palm strike sent the guy flying straight back, landing five feet from where Conner was standing; his arms extended from the massive amount of energy transferred.  \n\n  Conner’s system refreshed its depleted energy supply as he walked to both guys and put his Zippo in front of their mouths.  It fogged up on both.  Still breathing, that’s good.  Conner turned, the woman had stood but the glazed eyes remained.  \n\n  Fear terrorized his head as the adrenaline left his body.  Standing in front of him was a stunningly beautiful woman who, for some reason, he felt a cosmic draw.  She was walking toward him.  Oh shit.\n\n                                           `\n\n  Sophie looked at the two bruised fraternity brothers sleeping peacefully on their cement bed.  The shadow was a real person.  My protector, my knight in shining armor.  Yeah right, she thought, I bet he thinks he deserves a reward for saving me. \n \n  “Are you all right?”  The man asked.\n\n  She reached down and took both of the guy’s wallets.  “Yeah,” she kicked one in the stomach, “I’m much better now.”\n\n  “Touching,” the voice said as she turned to face it.  The street light overhead stirred back to life, blinding her.  Her hand shot up, shielding her eyes as she haphazardly scanned the perimeter trying to locate the voice in the time-space continuum.  \n\n  “Thank-you,” she said trying to bait an answer.  Who does this guy think he is?  Disappearing on me like that, I could have been hurt.  Her legs started moving, the houses disappearing in a blur.  Why am I running?  She stopped at the next street.  Nothing.  \n\n  She sat on the curb and pulled out her pack of Parliament Lights when her eyes were drawn down the road.  A streetlamp had gone out.  She squinted, noticing a figure walk past it.  The lamp turned back on.  \n\n  Huh, she thought, watching the figure intently, that’s interesting.  Once again, she found herself running without willing her body to do so.  \n\n\n\n\n","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1mip65","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"pcnicklaus","num_comments":6,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/1mip65/what_is_the_best_way_to_hijack_reddit_for_your/","name":"t3_1mip65","created":1379361889,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mip65/what_is_the_best_way_to_hijack_reddit_for_your/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"What is the best way to hijack reddit for your own purposes?","created_utc":1379358289,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":0},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_1mip65","likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"cc9ldsm","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"DirtyDandtheCrew","parent_id":"t3_1mip65","score":2,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Annnnnnnnnnd this is how not to do it...","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annnnnnnnnnd this is how not to do it...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","subreddit":"AskReddit","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cc9ldsm","created":1379362036,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":1379358436,"ups":2,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},"threadNum":5,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":7,"label":"negative"},{"question":"What do you think about George Bush","thread":{"domain":"self.AskReddit","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AskReddit","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I alternate between seeing him as a dumb charismatic guy who got manipulated by evil people around him and seeing him as one of those evil people himself.

No big deal.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walkled through the facade doorway into the light. The makeup made my eyes water a bit, but the genuine smile of the man at the desk put me at ease for the moment. His arm gestured to the chair next to his desk. I sat as previously instructed. It wasn&amp;#39;t really that bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m smiling. Good. Alright, let&amp;#39;s get this show on the road.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So, Jason, you&amp;#39;ve been making the rounds.

Would you mind if I asked chatterbot a few questions?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We actually rehearsed this part before. After a successful mock interview, I was to reset the state of chatterbot so that it would respond the same way a second time, and of course, it only parsed text input of the questions. We even changed the random number generator to a particular seed so that it would repeat the same sequence of random numbers for easy debugging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshman Seminar on Machine Ethics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Should we treat it as a person, though?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, that depends.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;I anticipated this one.

I was 9 years old, and it was one of if not &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; seminal moment of my childhood. It&amp;#39;s the reason I love movies today, it&amp;#39;s the reason Spielberg is my favourite director, and it&amp;#39;s pretty much my Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, I wanted to share my embarrassing tale in the hope that through cringing together you folks might crack a smile at my expense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s July 1993. 9 year old me had only recently developed an interest in girls, and there was nothing more exciting than seeing beautiful young actresses portraying exciting, exotic characters on the big screen. There must have been others before her, and there have certainly been many after, but at the time of release of the movie I became instantly infatuated with Ariana Richards, who many of you will know portrayed John Hammond&amp;#39;s tomboy/hacker granddaughter &amp;#39;Lex&amp;#39;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even as an early-pubescent 9 year old, I already knew that I had a thing for American girls, and all of a sudden here was this beautiful, intelligent, slightly older girl who not only was the sort of girl I could go exploring and kick a football with but who was probably as into computers as I was at that time. Obviously this was the character she played in the movie and not the actress herself, but nine-year-old me had a bit of a hard time separating the two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I&amp;#39;ll admit - the second (and third, and fourth) times I dragged my parents to the cinema that summer to re-watch the blockbuster of the decade, a film so exciting that one younger kid we knew who couldn&amp;#39;t quite pronounce the name properly yet called it &amp;#39;Drastic Park&amp;#39; (much to the amusement of our parents), I wasn&amp;#39;t entirely going just to see the T-Rex paddock scene again...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest, as they say, is history. The film became a blockbusting record breaking hit success. Unfortunately, there was only a finite number of times I could legitimately ask my parents to re-watch Jurassic Park with me. The summer came and went. This was the 90s. There was no internet to speak of and, apart from catching the odd featurette or film TV programme featuring clips of the movie, the mysterious and exciting girl I&amp;#39;d fallen for on the big screen was left largely to my imagination.  My older cousin used to gleefully mock me and my childish crush on, in his words, &amp;quot;...the girl with the smashed-in nose.&amp;quot;. But I didn&amp;#39;t care. I found myself constantly wondering what she was like in real life, wondering whether I&amp;#39;d ever meet any girl in reality who was as cool and unique as her character Lex. I&amp;#39;d absorb as much JP knowledge as possible, and even though for me it was always more about the movie as a whole, there was a part of me that would always pay special attention to trivia regarding Lex. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far so normal, right? I guess a lot of boys experience similar obsessions as they approach their teen years. Well hold onto your butts....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some time around October of &amp;#39;94, I began to, for whatever reason, tell people that Ariana Richards was my real-life girlfriend.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s right. Ariana Richards, possibly the most famous child-actress star of that time, a young, beautiful girl from sunny California was romantically linked to a chubby 10-year-old video game nerd (way before the &amp;#39;nerd&amp;#39; moniker somehow became &amp;#39;cool&amp;#39;) from a rainy town in the North-East of England. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:-0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I thought it was a good idea. I don&amp;#39;t know how I thought I was going to get away with it. But for some reason, it seemed like a good idea at the time. I guess in some weird way it was my attempt at living out my childish fantasy.... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective - my schoolmates and I were all of that age where some of us were starting to own up to being interested in girls, whilst others were approaching the tail end of the &amp;#39;girls make me vomit&amp;#39; stage. The majority of us would admit to having crushes on girls we knew, not that any of us would&amp;#39;ve had the first idea of what to do with them if we did. I think maybe at some point I made the classic childhood mistake of lying about already having a girlfriend. You know, the one that&amp;#39;s totally pretty and cool and funny but you don&amp;#39;t know her because she goes to a different school in a different country so you&amp;#39;ll never see us together but she definitely exists. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by this point I was already deflecting the accusations, and looking back I doubt anybody believed me, but then again kids are stupid. So I thought, well if you&amp;#39;re going to have a fake girlfriend, she may as well be famous. But why stop there? Why not make her one of the most famous girls on the face of the earth? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where I come from in the UK we have a saying:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In for a Penny; in for a Pound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I lied. I lied my tiny arse off. Most days I&amp;#39;d keep quiet and only reference her if directly questioned, revealing the details of our imaginary relationship little by little, gradually drip-feeding the lies to my hungry audience. They wouldn&amp;#39;t possibly be able to swallow my ginormous mistruth all in one go, but maybe, just maybe if I released information on a need-to-know basis, I could pull off the biggest trick since Verbal Kint pretended not to be Keyser Söze. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first I just had a girlfriend. It encouraged a little questioning but I was aloof enough about the whole situation not to raise any alarm bells, and my friend group were still at the age where we were unsure of girls, so no further enquiry was made. Then maybe a week or so later, I&amp;#39;d met her on holiday in the USA and we only communicated by letter, sometimes a phone call on special occasions.  Some people doubted me at this point, but I think I gave a pretty solid performance. I learned to let just enough information out to be believable, but not so much as to seem fantastical. A few weeks later and with one or two people asking me genuine questions about my American girlfriend, I felt like I could start to embellish a little more. I told people she was an actress, and that she liked to rollerblade (this would be my first ever &amp;#39;call-back&amp;#39; but more on that later). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even at that young age, my twisted little sociopathic mind was already working out the various facets of this lie from every conceivable angle and deciding how best to substantiate it. I think at the end of the day I didn&amp;#39;t really care whether they believed me or not, but I knew I was just young enough to get away with it or, at the very least, that being discovered as a heinous liar would have negligible consequences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t quite remember at what point I &amp;#39;let slip&amp;#39; that my mystery American actress girlfriend was actually world-famous child star and Brachiosaur-mucus-magnet Ariana Richards, but I vividly remember being gobsmacked at the reactions of my friends when they found out. They were not mocking me. They were not laughing at me They were not doubting me. Through an air-tight, detailed backstory and an Oscar-worthy performance over a period of about four months,  I had somehow sold this lie. I also remember being suddenly incredibly self-aware of my own shocked reaction to their bold-faced belief of my confession, and in a split second I corrected my face from that of &amp;#39;I can&amp;#39;t believe you&amp;#39;re buying this&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;yeah, I&amp;#39;m dating Ariana Richards, I didn&amp;#39;t realise it would be such a big deal...&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s now 1994. &amp;#39;The Ariana Lie&amp;#39; had pretty much spread through my entire year group at school and been mostly/widely accepted as gospel. There were one or two non-believers, and rightly so, but I had managed to keep things just vague enough that people knew me as &amp;#39;that guy with the famous girlfriend&amp;#39;. Once or twice I&amp;#39;d help things along by bringing in magazine article clippings that &amp;#39;she had sent me&amp;#39; from teen magazines (they actually belonged to my younger sister, who to this day has yet to solve &amp;#39;The Mystery Of The Midnight Magazine Clipper&amp;#39;...), and people would totally buy that they&amp;#39;d come all the way from my beloved Ariana. Like I said, kids are stupid. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other times I&amp;#39;d just act overly &amp;#39;lovey-dovey&amp;#39; at the mere thought of my girl; the two of us so in love and yet so far apart, whilst making sure people noticed... I don&amp;#39;t think I knew the tune to &amp;#39;My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean&amp;#39; at that age, but if I had I&amp;#39;d have whistled it constantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;d worry that my lie was losing traction, and I&amp;#39;d go to some pretty extreme lengths to re-corroborate the fallacy. Case-in-point: one morning, worried that I hadn&amp;#39;t brought any new information to light in recent weeks, I hatched a plan to act slightly down and depressed, not all-out despondent and crying but just sad-clown enough to cause suspicion amongst my classmates. It worked like a treat. After a good 20 minutes of being quieter and more reserved and thoughtful than my usual animated self, one of my female friends came over and asked me what was wrong. After a couple of textbook &amp;#39;shake-offs&amp;#39;, insisting that everything was okay but in such a way as to encourage further peeling of the emotional onion, I &amp;#39;broke down&amp;#39; and confessed: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Ariana&amp;#39;s been hurt in an accident!!&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[pause for cringe]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;She was out rollerblading on the beach...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (as my limited knowledge of America had led me to believe all Californians are wont to do) &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;...and she slipped on some broken glass and badly damaged her ankle; the doctors think it could be a small fracture...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I REALLY sold it.... (although, looking back, I really, REALLY didn&amp;#39;t.....). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow. That happened. I&amp;#39;ve relayed this story to many people over the course of my life, and that part is always the most difficult to get through. I don&amp;#39;t know who I thought I was fooling back then, but I think it would be safe to say that, at this point in the story, I upgraded to the nuclear option. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I dropped the Ariana-rollerblading-incident bombshell, two things happened:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The few people who were somewhat on the fence about the whole Ariana Lie fell completely off and called bullshit on the whole debacle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; I immediately received the fawning emotional and physical attention of some of the prettiest girls in my class, all clamouring to be a shoulder-to cry on and play nurse to this kid with the new-found emotional depths. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I particularly remember the attention of one girl, Michelle Duffy, who everyone had agreed was the most beautiful girl in our year, who put her arm around me and reassured me that everything would be alright. It was around this time that I began to realise that, were it not for being in a committed, stable, fictional relationship with the child-star of Jurassic Park, I might actually have a shot at having a real-life girlfriend back on planet Earth. But that was a moot point right now; I was too heavily-invested in this. I had seen all the angles and pre-empted pretty much every possible outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately what I did not pre-empt was that the people who were previously on the fence, now realising they had been conned for the better part of a year, began to dispute the entire affair with a renewed fervour, creating dissent amongst the masses and demanding to see concrete evidence of this relationship once and for all.  I knew that this time was different. The angry mob had the taste of blood on their lips and I knew that they would not stop until they had exposed me for the fraud I was. But no, I couldn&amp;#39;t let go, not yet, not after everything I had worked to build. I would have to weasel myself out of this with the same InGen-uity as I had weaseled myself in. If Rome were to fall, it would fall on &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; terms. One final fling, one last hurrah; once more unto the breach, dear friends! Once more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was October &amp;#39;94, and as well as this young Redditor&amp;#39;s 11th birthday, the home-release of Jurassic Park was swiftly approaching. I had persuaded my parents to let me have a JP birthday party, complete with a screening of the newly-released movie on VHS.  Like I said, The Ariana Lie was only one minuscule part of my relationship with the movie as a whole, and the fact that I could get one more lie out of this was merely the icing on the (birthday) cake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just needed something special, some last form of proof-of-life (proof-of-lie?) that would forever leave people wondering whether it had actually happened or not. I needed my Inception Spinning Top Totem. And for my 11th birthday, I got it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, our local Blockbuster Video (remember those?) was giving away free limited-edition theatrical JP posters to the first 100 people who bought or rented the movie on VHS. This was back in the days when nobody of our age bought or had any form of access to movie posters, certainly not in the one-sheet sizes that Universal Studios Home Video were offering. And so I had my party, and we all watched Jurassic Park for the first time since seeing it on the big-screen, and despite the grainy rental-video image on my parents comparatively tiny 28-inch Sony Trinitron, it was still as awesome as the first time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The week after, I proudly went into school with a &amp;#39;signed&amp;#39; Jurassic Park poster in my bag and calmly waited for one of the rabble-rousers to dare to question the authenticity of my grandiose claims of romantic entanglement. Looking back now this seems like the dumbest moment of all, but upon producing this &amp;#39;signed&amp;#39; poster at the end of the day, complete with autograph and THREE kisses from &amp;#39;...your darling Ariana&amp;#39;, even the loudest of dissenters seemed slightly quietened. I was particularly proud of my celebrity autograph forgery skills at that age. I had even borrowed one of my sister&amp;#39;s gold glitter-sparkle gel ink pens and studied her super-girly cursive handwriting to capture the essence of femininity for the fake signature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back now I still don&amp;#39;t know whether anyone actually bought any of it. I don&amp;#39;t imagine they did, but I like to think that a few of them had their doubts. A couple of weeks after that, as calmly as I had brought her into conversation, I let slip the sad news that Ariana and I had decided to break up. I think I mentioned the rigours of her professional life, and obviously the long-distance thing. Anyway, I was kinda down about it but I realised that, as fun as pretending to have a beautiful, famous girlfriend was, this fake relationship was never going to lead anywhere good. And I soon got over being fake-dumped when I told Michelle Duffy and to comfort me she held my hand for the first time. In that moment, I&amp;#39;d have left Lex in the kitchen with the raptors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As embarrassing as this story is, I weirdly enjoy the douche-chilles I get from re-living it. Maybe one day I&amp;#39;ll bump into Ariana Richards and creep her out by sharing it with her. Who knows, maybe she&amp;#39;ll find my awkward openness disarming. A guy can dream?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL; DR - When I was a kid I pretended (somewhat successfully) that Ariana Richards was my girlfriend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"*Go grab a delicious beverage and recline your chair because this one's a doozy.*\n\nWhen I need to place things in my memory I frequently use 20th July 1993 as a timeline date marker as the day when I first saw Jurassic Park at the UCI cinema in the Metro Centre, Gateshead (UK).  I was 9 years old, and it was one of if not **THE** seminal moment of my childhood. It's the reason I love movies today, it's the reason Spielberg is my favourite director, and it's pretty much my Star Wars.\n\nWith that out of the way, I wanted to share my embarrassing tale in the hope that through cringing together you folks might crack a smile at my expense.\n\nSo it's July 1993. 9 year old me had only recently developed an interest in girls, and there was nothing more exciting than seeing beautiful young actresses portraying exciting, exotic characters on the big screen. There must have been others before her, and there have certainly been many after, but at the time of release of the movie I became instantly infatuated with Ariana Richards, who many of you will know portrayed John Hammond's tomboy/hacker granddaughter 'Lex'.  \n\nEven as an early-pubescent 9 year old, I already knew that I had a thing for American girls, and all of a sudden here was this beautiful, intelligent, slightly older girl who not only was the sort of girl I could go exploring and kick a football with but who was probably as into computers as I was at that time. Obviously this was the character she played in the movie and not the actress herself, but nine-year-old me had a bit of a hard time separating the two. \n\nAnd so I'll admit - the second (and third, and fourth) times I dragged my parents to the cinema that summer to re-watch the blockbuster of the decade, a film so exciting that one younger kid we knew who couldn't quite pronounce the name properly yet called it 'Drastic Park' (much to the amusement of our parents), I wasn't entirely going just to see the T-Rex paddock scene again...\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. The film became a blockbusting record breaking hit success. Unfortunately, there was only a finite number of times I could legitimately ask my parents to re-watch Jurassic Park with me. The summer came and went. This was the 90s. There was no internet to speak of and, apart from catching the odd featurette or film TV programme featuring clips of the movie, the mysterious and exciting girl I'd fallen for on the big screen was left largely to my imagination.  My older cousin used to gleefully mock me and my childish crush on, in his words, \"...the girl with the smashed-in nose.\". But I didn't care. I found myself constantly wondering what she was like in real life, wondering whether I'd ever meet any girl in reality who was as cool and unique as her character Lex. I'd absorb as much JP knowledge as possible, and even though for me it was always more about the movie as a whole, there was a part of me that would always pay special attention to trivia regarding Lex. \n\nSo far so normal, right? I guess a lot of boys experience similar obsessions as they approach their teen years. Well hold onto your butts....\n\n**Some time around October of '94, I began to, for whatever reason, tell people that Ariana Richards was my real-life girlfriend.** \n\nYes, that's right. Ariana Richards, possibly the most famous child-actress star of that time, a young, beautiful girl from sunny California was romantically linked to a chubby 10-year-old video game nerd (way before the 'nerd' moniker somehow became 'cool') from a rainy town in the North-East of England. \n\n**:-0**\n\nI don't know why I thought it was a good idea. I don't know how I thought I was going to get away with it. But for some reason, it seemed like a good idea at the time. I guess in some weird way it was my attempt at living out my childish fantasy.... \n\nTo put this into perspective - my schoolmates and I were all of that age where some of us were starting to own up to being interested in girls, whilst others were approaching the tail end of the 'girls make me vomit' stage. The majority of us would admit to having crushes on girls we knew, not that any of us would've had the first idea of what to do with them if we did. I think maybe at some point I made the classic childhood mistake of lying about already having a girlfriend. You know, the one that's totally pretty and cool and funny but you don't know her because she goes to a different school in a different country so you'll never see us together but she definitely exists. \n\nSo by this point I was already deflecting the accusations, and looking back I doubt anybody believed me, but then again kids are stupid. So I thought, well if you're going to have a fake girlfriend, she may as well be famous. But why stop there? Why not make her one of the most famous girls on the face of the earth? \n\nWhere I come from in the UK we have a saying:\n\n*In for a Penny; in for a Pound.*\n\nAnd so I lied. I lied my tiny arse off. Most days I'd keep quiet and only reference her if directly questioned, revealing the details of our imaginary relationship little by little, gradually drip-feeding the lies to my hungry audience. They wouldn't possibly be able to swallow my ginormous mistruth all in one go, but maybe, just maybe if I released information on a need-to-know basis, I could pull off the biggest trick since Verbal Kint pretended not to be Keyser Söze. \n\nAt first I just had a girlfriend.

Here are the 13 ideas, the title and a brief introduction to the story. Some of these are going to be short stories if they win, so ill include that as well. I have very little thought to the titles of these books, so its no unlikely I will change them Enough talkin-...Enough typing! Here we go.\n&lt;strong&gt;Book One: 14 Wesly&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis book takes three different approaches of getting the story out. The first is a Police officer in a police report that he is to hand into his higher ups. His purpose is to remind the reader everything they are reading is within a police file. He is also there to simplify moments (for his boss, also works for the reader) and point out when time skips happen-&amp;quot;That is the last thing written for eight hours.&amp;quot;. The second view is the main character, who is currently unamed. You can submit a name, if you would like to. She is a 14 year old girl who has never fit in. Her favourite spot in her town was destroyed due to construction, so she sets off looking for a new, abandoned place to spend all her time alone. She finds an old house on 14 Wesly street, and finds an old type machine, where she decides to record her days in the house and what shes done. Turns out, a ghost also lives in the house. The ghost is the third perspective. He rarely types anything, its usually just the girl typing what she see&amp;#39;s, but the ghost is basically scum bag Steve. At one point the girl asks why he is doing this, and he replies &amp;quot;Its been far too long since someone burned to death in this house.&amp;quot; As he sets the house on fire with her trapped in.\nTL;DR: A 14 year old girl is trapped in a haunted house with a sick ghost whose only goal is to drive her mad. The whole thing is recorded through a typing machine found in the house, where the girl writes everything thats going on. &lt;strong&gt;SHORT STORY!&lt;/strong&gt; \n&lt;strong&gt;SECOND STORY: Lege&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis is my personal favorite. Lege is Norwegian for doctor. This takes place during the era when pirates ruled the world, and were in constant battle with the government. Lege is the main character, Who&amp;#39;s real name is Wallie Keic. He got his name from being the single best doctor on the sea. He has a crew of 3 apprentices who wanted to learn his ways. Lege has the finest ship (Far too big for four people), Finest weapons (None of them can handle a sword or a gun) and finest medical equipment. Who did Lege afford all these things he doesnt use? Simple. Lege finds the greatest pirates on the sea, kills their crew, and does serious damage to the captain. He then takes all their gold in return for healing the captain. Lege himself is not very big, but his mind is. Think of him as a cocky batman. He makes wise cracks, gets wasted several time through the day and teaches his three students how to fight, bargain, know how to run away and....What was it?...Oh man. OH RIGHT! Actually heal people! The problem of the book is that both the military and the pirates hate Lege, and they finally make a special devision of highly trained assassins to take Lege out. Can his silver tounge and sneaky ways get him out of it? No, they can&amp;#39;t. \nThis will be a longer story. &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: A bad-ass doctor names Lege goes around beating up the greatest pirates on the sea, and charging them to heal them. Lege allways had a few enemys, but now the entire ocean is on his tail.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im only on the second one, and my fingers are tired. Im going to start writing alot less. A tl;dr of the story.\n&lt;strong&gt;THE THIRD IDEA: How Long Is Eternity?&lt;/strong&gt;\nA firefighter gets a call to a house in the middle of the night, and 3 kids are stuck inside. He ventures inside to get the kids, but he gets trapped in a time loop. He stays in the burning house for eternity. SHORT STORY\n&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Idea: Pennies and Dimes&lt;/strong&gt;\nA poor make up artist and his friend who is brilliant tech wise find a way to steal money from the most wealthy peoples bank accounts. When their identity&amp;#39;s get out, the wealthy don&amp;#39;t settle for an arrest. They hire hundreds of mercenarys to kill the two. \n&lt;strong&gt;Fith Story: Muscle Man&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis takes place is a world where there lives on Superhero: Muscle Man. The only downside is, Hes kind of a prick. He kills men for petty crimes, but the police usually let him off. Then he goes and kills a kid for a murder the kid didnt do. Now its Police VS Muscle man. Takes place in a  made up city, the city resembles New York City. The story is told through a police officer, who to sum him is kind of like That one cop you focus on in the Dark Knight, not Gordon. Not a very long story.\n** Sixth Story: Jackie McIntyre.**\nThis story takes place in the dark sixties. Jackie McIntyre is the worlds sneakiest man, who is feared by police. Jackie emptys banks daily, and lives in a castle. Nobody can match Jackie in wit, Until a new police officer joins the force. He doesnt understand why nobody peruses Jackie, and now the fight begins. Kind of like Death Note, except the 60&amp;#39;S Have a huge impact on how people re-act. This story is one of the longest.\n&lt;strong&gt;STORY SEVEN&lt;/strong&gt; If Muscle man wins, This whole thing is a spoiler for it. It takes place in his universe. A punk teenage who was allways an outcast wants the world to himself and his cat, and after years of trying, Muscle Man dies. He sneaks into Muscle Mans lair, and find a device the can stop time in certain areas. He freezes everyone, and after a month of doing what ever he wants, he realizes he wants everyone back. Only its too late. He is the only man on earth. With his cat. This story is medium. \n&lt;strong&gt;Eight: Clowns VS Ninjas&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis is the shortest story, it would be a book for children. In the scary Olympics (A completion to see who can scare kids the best, Demonic Ninjas and clowns tie. This starts an all out war. Pie throwing and slipping on banana peels! OH YEAH!! \n&lt;strong&gt;Nine: I can&amp;#39;t think of a title.&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis is another one of my favorites. It has no name, so if you vote for it tell me a name if youd like. This follows a magician during the ages when people were killed for acting like witches. He keeps his secret from everyone, until he find out demons will invade the earth within ten days. This book would be for 8-10 year olds. Around 100 pages.\n&lt;strong&gt;Book Ten: We Own This World!&lt;/strong&gt;\n A book about what people really want. An elite Gangster group of four who were laughed at for years are in the worlds best guarded prison when a nuclear was happens. One quater of all humans are wiped out. Three of the villains survive, and seize the Opportunity to RULE THE WORLD! This is a short story.\n** Story Eleven: &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/72kK3\"&gt;To Be Announced&lt;/a&gt;**\nThis one is med evil. The best archer in the world decides to get into the business of killing people for money. His first job leads him into The Masters, A group witch he later finds out wants to kill every kingdom and have the world to themselves. If he steps out of line, he is killed. Can he stop them? Will it be too late?! WILL HE GET ANOTHER JOB AFTER THIS ONE?!!? Find out next week, On Dragon Ball Z!..Or if you vote for this one. \n&lt;strong&gt;Story 12: King&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis is probably my least favorite, but someone may like it. It would be pretty short. We are introduced to a depressed guy, who has a superpower that sounds good but is actually rotten. Everybody obeys him. He cannot talk to anyone about anything without them just listening for orders. The main guy isnt funny, he is just tired of living in a fake world. SPOILER ALERT: He kills himself in the God-damn face.\n&lt;strong&gt;LAST STORY: I don&amp;#39;t have any ideas for the title.&lt;/strong&gt;\nA bounty hunter from the Middle Ages Takes an order to kill a gang of bag guys. Normal stuff. Turns out, the person who hired him knew something he didnt. The King of their kingdom snuck off during the night to convince these guys to attack his kingdom. He was going to defend the kingdom when they came ( Like have everybody set up for battle on a hunch, and when he was right he seems amazing). But his brother found out his plot, and sent our main hero to kill the king. The brother will then take over the empty throne! But after all the men are dead, the city guards come to investigate the noise, and find the king dead among the many bad guys. They think that the bad guys killed the king, and dressed him up to look evil. Now, they see the bounty hunter as a hero for killing those terrible guys, and declare him the new king. This starts a battle between the new king and the brother. This is among my favorites. This would be a pretty long book.\nWell now, VOTE! Any feedback would be good too.

I&amp;#39;ll be back in like, 8 hours (sorry!))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the title states, my diet is horrible.  Its been essentially the same ever since I got off baby food.  My brother used to be almost the same, just not quite as bad, though he&amp;#39;s gotten over it for the most part now.  From what I was told, my dad was the same way, but grew out of it in his teens too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t eat vegetables.  Like, at all.  The rarely, I&amp;#39;ll eat corn on the cob.  Has to be on the cob though, can&amp;#39;t stand eating it already removed from the cob.  Probably has something to do with my dad desperately trying to force me to eat it as a kid growing up.  But seriously that&amp;#39;s the most vegetables I eat.  Even then, I only eat it when I&amp;#39;m out at a par restaurant (Applebees, Chilis, etc.) with some friends and I don&amp;#39;t want to feel too strange.  But that&amp;#39;s it.  No carrots, no lettuce, I guess you could count tomatoes because I eat Pizza a couple times a month.  Sometimes some spaghetti.  But the pizza sauce in my spaghetti has to be like, puréed.  I can&amp;#39;t stand the tomato chunks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you count potatoes and rice to be vegetables, I eat those too.  Though, not on a regular basis.  But often.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t eat fruit.  The only fruit I enjoy to eat are bananas.  I probably haven&amp;#39;t had a banana since I moved out of my parents house (4 years ago).  I used to eat apple sauce (back when I was with my parents), but other than that, I can&amp;#39;t think of any alternatives to fruit that I eat.  I don&amp;#39;t mind apple juice, grape juice, wine, lemonade?  But that&amp;#39;s about it.  Again, can&amp;#39;t think of any other sort of fruit I&amp;#39;ll eat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, when I had my first roommate that I shared an apartment with, he thought he&amp;#39;d just adapt to my diet because it would be easier on groceries.  Needless to say, about a month after rooming together, he started having random black outs.  Asked his friend who was going to school (i think probably 3rd year in by then?) to be a nutritionist what her take on it was, and she said it sounded like a vitamin b12 deficiency and asked if he was eating a proper amount of fruits and vegetables.  He took her advice, black outs went away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kid couldn&amp;#39;t go a month doing what I&amp;#39;ve been doing 20 years at the time and started blacking out.  (mind you, they weren&amp;#39;t long black outs, just for a couple seconds.)  Blacked out while driving on the high way going 70 miles an hour once.  I was in the passenger seat.  Scared the fuck out of me.  He&amp;#39;d done it multiple times when I was around.  The first time, mid conversation.  He was laying in bed though, I thought he was just being crazy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what my diet looks like normally.  I typically skip breakfast.  I snack on grilled cheese throughout the day.  Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll go as far as to make a quesadilla instead.  Just the tortilla and cheese though.  No chicken or steak.  For dinner, I normally eat steak and rice.   Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll substitute for pork chops or chicken breasts.  All home cooked, by the way.  I used to alternate each week.  Buy steak one week, chicken the next, pork after that, then steak, and so on.  That&amp;#39;s pretty much it.   Before I turned 21, I used to drink a lot of soda.  I mean, a LOT of soda.  I&amp;#39;d probably kill a 12 pack in a day, two days, tops.  Probably go through 8, 12 packs a week.  Then I turned 21, and now I go through much less soda, and probably 2, 12 packs of beer a week.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works both ways though, too, I guess.  Its not just healthy stuff I wont eat.  Many sweets too.  I dont like pie, the only cake I eat is white cake.  Dont like brownies, few candies I eat, few chips I eat, don&amp;#39;t even know what else.  Its hard, naming everything you don&amp;#39;t like to eat, when you barely like to eat anything.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 22 years old, I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot;, 160 pounds, run a mile in 6:30, never eaten a carrot in my life (ok, I&amp;#39;ve had less baby carrots than I do fingers throughout it, just to prove that my taste buds &amp;quot;haven&amp;#39;t magically changed&amp;quot;) and have 20/20, unassisted, never treated, eye-sight.  Pretty much, I&amp;#39;m fully functioning, I don&amp;#39;t have any health issues, a lot of people think I should be dead right now, but I&amp;#39;m not.  Have taken vitamins inconsistently in the past, kind of felt like I was just wasting money.  Oh, and to top it all off, my aunt has some sort of degree in personal fitness or something, with a minor in nutrition.  I forget really, but she works at a gym, helps people get skinny and what not.  Every time I see her she gives me the health talk.  My grandma on my dad&amp;#39;s side pretty much raised all of her kids in the art of gardening.  All of my aunts, uncles, even my dad for a little while (it became too much for him to manage due to our household situation) had a garden.  There was always the freshest of vegetables at all of our family events.   Its a sin not to eat my grandmother&amp;#39;s vegetables.

It's sci-fi fantasy mashup where in the future, Earth has \"actors\" that record and manipulate events in an alternate dimension called \"Overworld\". The main character, Caine, has over the course of his career committed genocide on a clan of orcs, caused a civil war by assassinating the head of an empire, etc. He's extremely sociopathic and only redeemable (in the first book) by his love of his wife.\nIt's been described as \"Lord of the Rings meets Day of the Jackal\"\n\nhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheActsOfCaine\n\n**Recommendation 2: Second Apocalypse Trilogy by R.

From attempting to forge new friendships to adjusting to the new environment. Many of us know what it feels like to be in this situation. A lot of us learned that humor can help. Some of us may have tried too hard to be funny. You may not like to admit it, but if you done more than one of the following: deliberately injuring yourself, shouting profanity at random intervals, and/or mocking the less fortunate students, then you were probably trying too hard to be funny. Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;m right there with you. Let me share some embarrassing stories with you so you can see how desperate I was to be funny and laugh at my pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the summer of fifth grade. The blazing sun radiated its warmth on to my skin. I was eleven and didn&amp;#39;t have a care in the world. My daily schedule included capturing the other team&amp;#39;s flag and avoiding cooties from the girls next door. That was until I learned I was moving to another state within a couple of weeks. It hit me harder than the tornado hit Dorothy&amp;#39;s house in the Wizard of Oz. My Kansas was gone. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I&amp;#39;m the new kid at school. I was never the most socially outgoing kid when I was younger. It was hard to make friends until I realized that people laughed when I got hurt. Tripping, hitting my funny bone, and more tripping. They were laughing at me, not with me. Did I care though? No, I finally found something that attracted attention towards me. In turn this allowed me to make new friends. So desperate I was for attention. The number of injuries I accumulated that year was too damn high. It got worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s safe to say that many of us hated middle school. I try to repress these memories. The awkward hormone phase begins in middle school. No longer did I injure myself as much as I did. However, my new specialty was to sexually moan at times I deemed fit. I really don&amp;#39;t want to continue talking about my middle school adventures, but I feel obligated to. Anyways, I soon found out that snorting random miscellaneous sundries was my new hobby. People thought it was hilarious and so I did it. Cocoa powder was my cocaine. Oh boy, did I feel like a badass. My lungs said otherwise. You get the picture, so I&amp;#39;m going to stop torturing myself now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question of why some of us try so hard to be funny? If you were anything like me, then you probably enjoyed being the center of attention when you cracked a few jokes. But why do we want attention? The lust for attention may come from our conscious or unconscious want of a loving and admiring presence to satisfy our own innate desire of being wanted. Seeking attention may also stem from our lack of self-esteem as we feel like we need to somehow prove ourselves. That being said, it was also easier to make friends when you were the funny guy. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with trying to be in the limelight and making friends, especially if you&amp;#39;re the new kid, but if you&amp;#39;re injuring yourself to incite a few laughs within your peers, then I advise you to reevaluate your strategies. It wasn&amp;#39;t until the end of my high school career that I finally found myself not giving a rat&amp;#39;s ass about being funny. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I loved making other&amp;#39;s laugh, but not at the expense of my body or dignity. Sexual moans and snorting cocoa powder were replaced with dry sarcasm and witty retorts. The less funny I tried to be, the more funny I became in a sense. Humor flowed naturally the less I thought about it. My advice to my brothers and sisters who so desperately try to be funny, just chill out. Don&amp;#39;t force it if doesn&amp;#39;t come right away. Wait for the perfect moment to strike. Better yet, don&amp;#39;t even think about it. The less you think about being funny, the less you&amp;#39;ll stress about thinking of the next big funny thing to say. Even though I care far less about being the funny guy, I still live by my motto: humor is the spice of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So reddit, what stupid things did you do to be funny?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Being the new kid is hard.

If reddit thinks the opposite, well this can quietly die and we can leave his ego be, haha.  \n  \nthanks for taking the time and I hope you guys like it.\n\nhttp://www.funnyordie.com/videos/64e2e3d56f/jacob-wilson-performs-at-the-finals-of-the-2010-rocky-top-comedy-contest","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"11binc","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NeonSubtlety","num_comments":0,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/11binc/reddit_does_my_buddy_have_any_comedy_chops/","name":"t3_11binc","created":1349981397,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11binc/reddit_does_my_buddy_have_any_comedy_chops/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Reddit, does my buddy have any comedy chops?","created_utc":1349977797,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":false,"threadNum":14,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":15,"label":"negative"},{"question":"Wouldn't you rather be human?","thread":{"domain":"self.AskReddit","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AskReddit","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know death is certain and that as humans we seldom have control of the way it happens.

It was an accident!&amp;quot; pleaded Kurt as he bent over to pick up the shattered remains of the album. When I got over that problem, I looked at the rest of the apartment. Trashed. It looks like a tornado with an attitude problem crashed through. Lamps broken and on the floor, curtains ripped to shreds, food tossed around like it was a new carpet, glass everywhere, and what looked like thick, red ink all over the walls.\n&amp;quot;Kurt, what happened?&amp;quot; I pondered out loud. Then, he lashed out.\n&amp;quot;NOTHING! Nothing happened! Now please leave!!&amp;quot; yelled Kurt. He grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me out the door with a force I never knew he had. &amp;quot;Goodbye!&amp;quot; he screamed as he slammed the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is James Grohl. I live in gloomy, rainy Aberdeen, Washington. The one part of the Earth the Sun never seems to have time for. It&amp;#39;s the dawn of a new era, 1991. Not a good era, just a new one. My friend, Kurt Noveselic, has been my best friend since we were five. Sixteen years later, we still somehow tolerate each other enough to call ourselves &amp;quot;Best Buds.&amp;quot; Kurt, while still a good guy with a great heart, has a bleak personal history. When he was four, he saw his Mother get stabbed multiple times in the heart by his Father-in-law. The brutal part is that it was with a red pen. The dirty old man didn&amp;#39;t even have the curtousy to make it quick with a knife. He threw the bloody pen at Kurt, and for some reason Kurt kept it. I guess it&amp;#39;s all he had to remember her by, since he was very poor. After that, he was taken in by his Father-in-law, whom he obviously hated. Soon after they moved here, he escaped his twisted father and fled. He wanted to have a real life and enroll in public school, so he walked into Spirit Elementary one day with the approval of the principal. That&amp;#39;s when I first saw him. I was so fascinated at the story he told, probably the only one. I&amp;#39;d finally found a fellow five year old as mature as me. Soon enough, we were in Junior High. Kurt was now living with his grandmother, and his Father-in-law died of heart failure. He was legally diagnosed with mental instability, and once in a while had dark outbursts. But now, he seems to be in contol of himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;.......Thank you Donald. And now a special newsbreak.....this morning, at around 3:30 a.m., two men, both approximately in their early to mid thirties, were brutally slain on this abandoned highway. Choppers located the bodies while on a routine scan of the city, and report that both bodies were placed in a praying position against the curb. No futher details were mentioned, but police say the person responsible will be apprehended and brought to justice.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Wow.....what a way to go, aye Kurt?&amp;quot;, I said, sitting on the counter of my dimly lit apartment.\n&amp;quot;Yeah.....&amp;quot;, Kurt whispered, laying on the couch fiddling with his mother&amp;#39;s creepy death pen, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve gotta go.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Go where? Your place is trashed, you can&amp;#39;t even navigate around in there!&amp;quot;, I said.\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve gotta go, I&amp;#39;ve gotta go, I can&amp;#39;t be here right now.&amp;quot; Kurt mumbled as he ran out the door.\n&amp;quot;Ok then.....bye!&amp;quot; I yelled, but he didn&amp;#39;t hear. He was long gone. What was that all about? This morning he&amp;#39;s destroying his apartment and literally throwing me out the door, now he&amp;#39;s freaking out over nothing at all. It&amp;#39;s weird, he was just fine before the news was on. It&amp;#39;s not like HE murdered those people or anything. Kurt wouldn&amp;#39;t kill an insect, let alone two human beings. Maybe his outbursts are coming back, like when we were kids. But that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense, his freak out sessions were usually an array of Satanic screams and shrieks, not mumbling and busting my records. Maybe he is just having some personal problems he isn&amp;#39;t telling me about. I&amp;#39;ll just give it some time and call him about it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEEP&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot;......Hey you almost reached Kurt, sorry you didn&amp;#39;t. Leave a message if you want. I can&amp;#39;t guarantee I&amp;#39;ll have the incentive to get back to you though. Thanks.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;BEEP&lt;/em&gt;\n&amp;quot;Kurt? Kurt, I know you&amp;#39;re there man, pick up. It&amp;#39;s James................alright. Call me when you get home. Please.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s the twelfth call I&amp;#39;ve given him. It&amp;#39;s been two days since he stormed out of my house after the news report. I&amp;#39;m really concerned for him right now. It&amp;#39;s freaking me out in a big, bad way. That night, and last night as well, eight more people were murdered in the same way as the two unfortunate individuals before. One was unidentified, but was given a physical desription similar to that of Kurt&amp;#39;s. Long blond hair, about five foot eleven and one-hundred and forty pounds, an unshaven face, and very light blue eyes. That was his most recognizable physical feature. His piercing, almost white eyes. I hope to God he is ok.\n&lt;em&gt;KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK&lt;/em&gt;. I hurried to the door hoping it was him. As I opened the door, I saw before me two rather vicious looking police officers. One towering me in size and looks like he can bench a truck, and the other shorter than me, but still looks like he can put me in intense pain.\n&amp;quot;Excuse me, are you James Grohl?&amp;quot; said the short one. The big guy must not be the talker.\n&amp;quot;Y-yes, that&amp;#39;s me. What&amp;#39;s wrong, Officer?&amp;quot; I said, confused at why the cops are here and why they know my name.\n&amp;quot;It says here that you are good friends with a man named Kurt Noveselic. Is this true?&amp;quot; said the officer in a dead-pan voice.\n&amp;quot;Yes, that&amp;#39;s correct, we are best friends. What, did he get hurt?&amp;quot; I said, jumping to that horrible conclusion I sensed coming on.\n&amp;quot;No, quite the opposite actually. Your friend&amp;#39;s fingerprints were found all over the scenes of those murders. We need to locate him right now for some questioning. Can you please disclose his address immedietly?&amp;quot;. What? Kurt&amp;#39;s fingerprints all over those scenes? That can&amp;#39;t be possible, he isn&amp;#39;t a murderer. He can&amp;#39;t even kill a good mood. But it would explain his odd distance as of late.\n&amp;quot;Um.....he actually just moved so I&amp;#39;m not sure where he lives now. I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot; I lied, &amp;quot;Is there any other evidence to prove it?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Yes, a slightly chewed up pen cap. Just call the authorities when you find him. Your friend could possibly be a murderer, and you can&amp;#39;t let him get away with it.&amp;quot;, the man said with great authority. A pen cap. That is too much of a coincidence. The two policeman left the building and drove off in their vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go over to his house right now. I need to make sure he hasnt finally snapped from years of built up emotion. Part of how he controlled his dim outbursts before was learning how not to show anger or sadness. What happened a couple days ago certainly seemed angry and sad.\nAs I walk up to his apartment door, I notice a slight change in the color hue of the hallways. When I walked into the building, and everytime I&amp;#39;ve been here before, they were are a bright yellow, like the Sun. Now, as I get closer and closer to his room, I see it go from a cheery yellow to a dark, disturbing, almost rotten yellow the likes of which I&amp;#39;ve never seen. It&amp;#39;s like, the air is a little murkier around this room at all times. I grasped onto the handle, knowing Kurt never locks his door, and immediatly pulled back. It was freezing cold, almost literally frozen. He must have the tempurature at arctic levels in there. I braced myself and sheepishly grabbed the handle again, expecting another cold rush. But this time, it was burning hot. It was even steeming a little. What in the world is happenening in there? How did the temperature change so dramatically in seconds? Now without hesitation, I grabbed the handle and threw the door open. It was completely dark, except for a light shining from what could be a TV coming from Kurt&amp;#39;s room. I flipped the switch, but the light didn&amp;#39;t come on. I remembered Kurt was too lazy to buy another bulb for his ceiling light, so he freely walked across his house in the dark at night. With a little formal training myself, I easily walked across Kurt&amp;#39;s floor. He obviously cleaned up his mess, because I wasn&amp;#39;t having trouble at all.\nAs I walked into Kurt&amp;#39;s room, I saw the light was indeed from a television. But it was displaying the snowy effect it does when there is no signal. I looked at the floor and saw a can of cold Pepsi, a half-eaten bowl of cereal, and a thick book. It was Kurt&amp;#39;s diary. He kept one ever since his mother was killed, and has written in it everytime something eventful happened in his life. I hate to intrude on Kurt&amp;#39;s personal things, but if there was ever a good time to invade his privacy, it was now. I looked at the last entry, dated three days ago.\n&amp;quot;April 23, 1991. I thought I did it years ago. But it turns out Mom was just the first in a string of them. Lord, with your power inside me, I&amp;#39;ll rid the World of these pests...&amp;quot; What? What on Earth does that mean? His mom was the first in a string of what? I read on....., &amp;quot;Earth doesn&amp;#39;t need this evil. I&amp;#39;ll do it the way you want, with my pen. The pen you gave me all those years ago. Just like mom, they will feel the pain of all their sins. Kurt.&amp;quot; As I read the last line, I had a revelation. More, a question. Did Kurt kill his mother? Has he been lying to me all these years, and was his father really a decent, honest man? I have to find him right now. I need to ask him if this means what I think it means. If so....then those cops were right. Kurt is a murderer.\nI left Kurt&amp;#39;s apartment in a mix of several different emotions. Pain, grief, sadness, I even cried on my way back to my apartment. My best friend can&amp;#39;t be a killer. He just isn&amp;#39;t that kind of man. If he did have a problem with someone, he wouldn&amp;#39;t kill them. He&amp;#39;d just show off his smart-guy attitude and shrug it off like nothing. He doesn&amp;#39;t let somber things get to him. Not after his mother died.......or after he killed her.....I don&amp;#39;t even know anymore. I finally made it up the steep steps of my dirty little home.\n&amp;quot;KURT!&amp;quot; I screamed, horrified at what was before my very eyes. Blood, everywhere. On the walls, on the carpet, and all over.....him. Kurt was in the dead center of my living room, hunched over a large, decrepid bowl full of blood. He was stirring it, like a witch over it&amp;#39;s cauldron. &amp;quot;Kurt....what the Hell is going on?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;I couldnt stay at my house, they&amp;#39;ll find me there!&amp;quot; cried Kurt. I knew what he was talking about.\n&amp;quot;Kurt....I need you to be honest with me. Did.....did you kill those people on the news?&amp;quot; I asked, afraid of the answer I knew was coming.\n&amp;quot;Yes, James. Yes, I killed them. They deserved it!&amp;quot; said Kurt, the last part at the top of his lungs. Kurt never lied, so I knew he would fess to it.\n&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; I asked. Then, he went nuts.\n&amp;quot;THEY DESERVED IT!!! They were worshipping Satan, James! I saw them with my own eyes! And....a-and God told me to kill them!&amp;quot; Kurt bellowed, standing up so fast his bowl of blood almost tipped over. It wouldnt matter, my carpet&amp;#39;s already drenched in it. He stalked over to me like I was thin air. &amp;quot;God gave me this pen, James. H-h-he told m-me to do it. It was God&amp;#39;s grace! I couldn&amp;#39;t say no!&amp;quot;. I was disgusted at what I was hearing.\n&amp;quot;I read your diary, Kurt.&amp;quot; I whispered.\n&amp;quot;WHAT?? You know how important my privacy is, James!&amp;quot; Kurt screamed. He threw his spoon on the ground so hard it almost cracked my kitchen tile.\n&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t care, Kurt. You killed your mother didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; I asked with authority.\n&amp;quot;Yes, bu-&amp;quot; Kurt began. But I was in no mood for &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;&amp;#39;s.\n&amp;quot;And your father was innocent. You lied to me Kurt. All these years, you have been living a lie. I always gave you pity and excused your crazy behavior, but that was because I thought you witnessed your mother die in cold blood. But now that I know it was by your hand.......I...I just don&amp;#39;t know what to say, Kurt. You aren&amp;#39;t speaking to God.&amp;quot; I said, slightly hurt by my own words. But I meant it.

Tragedy again tonight, as yet another person has fallen victim to the mysterious &amp;quot;Blood Draining Killer&amp;quot;, a young man named James Grohl, a native of Aberdeen. Police have linked the murder to a man named Kurt Noveselic, who police say, oddly enough, was a good friend of James. Noveselic&amp;#39;s fingerprints were all over the scene of the crime, this time Grohl&amp;#39;s South Aberdeen apartment. The scene was horrific. Blood all over the place, authorities are telling me. As well, three unidentified bodies were found in the closet of the apartment, hanging from the ceiling like puppets. The body of Grohl was found in the trademark praying position which has been the case with the past murders by this maniac. Police say an extensive search of the entire city will be taken until Kurt Noveselic is found, dead or alive. This is Katie Parker, FOX news.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;April 27th, 1991. There you go, Lord. I finally got rid of the evil. All along, it turns out the evil was inside of James. You must have known all along Lord. You know everything. It was fate that we met in Elementary school. You wanted me to befriend him, so one day I could take his rotten life away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this entry in blood, James&amp;#39;s blood. Just as you asked. As you said, &amp;#39;write in the evil&amp;#39;s blood, Kurt&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;d spent so long, gathering blood of all the damned souls in Aberdeen, hoping I&amp;#39;d made the right concoction. I wish I&amp;#39;d known it was in James the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your will is done. I have saved your name. Kurt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Wrote this for a class. Happy Halloween!\n\nRED PEN.\n\n\"Kurt!\" I screamed, horrified at what was before my very eyes. \"You broke my favorite Nirvana record!\"\n\"I'm sorry, James, it just kinda happened! It was an accident!\" pleaded Kurt as he bent over to pick up the shattered remains of the album. When I got over that problem, I looked at the rest of the apartment. Trashed. It looks like a tornado with an attitude problem crashed through. Lamps broken and on the floor, curtains ripped to shreds, food tossed around like it was a new carpet, glass everywhere, and what looked like thick, red ink all over the walls.\n\"Kurt, what happened?\" I pondered out loud. Then, he lashed out.\n\"NOTHING! Nothing happened! Now please leave!!\" yelled Kurt. He grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me out the door with a force I never knew he had. \"Goodbye!\" he screamed as he slammed the door.\n\nMy name is James Grohl. I live in gloomy, rainy Aberdeen, Washington. The one part of the Earth the Sun never seems to have time for. It's the dawn of a new era, 1991. Not a good era, just a new one. My friend, Kurt Noveselic, has been my best friend since we were five. Sixteen years later, we still somehow tolerate each other enough to call ourselves \"Best Buds.\" Kurt, while still a good guy with a great heart, has a bleak personal history. When he was four, he saw his Mother get stabbed multiple times in the heart by his Father-in-law. The brutal part is that it was with a red pen. The dirty old man didn't even have the curtousy to make it quick with a knife. He threw the bloody pen at Kurt, and for some reason Kurt kept it. I guess it's all he had to remember her by, since he was very poor. After that, he was taken in by his Father-in-law, whom he obviously hated. Soon after they moved here, he escaped his twisted father and fled. He wanted to have a real life and enroll in public school, so he walked into Spirit Elementary one day with the approval of the principal. That's when I first saw him. I was so fascinated at the story he told, probably the only one. I'd finally found a fellow five year old as mature as me. Soon enough, we were in Junior High. Kurt was now living with his grandmother, and his Father-in-law died of heart failure. He was legally diagnosed with mental instability, and once in a while had dark outbursts. But now, he seems to be in contol of himself.\n\n\".......Thank you Donald. And now a special newsbreak.....this morning, at around 3:30 a.m., two men, both approximately in their early to mid thirties, were brutally slain on this abandoned highway. Choppers located the bodies while on a routine scan of the city, and report that both bodies were placed in a praying position against the curb. No futher details were mentioned, but police say the person responsible will be apprehended and brought to justice.\"\n\"Wow.....what a way to go, aye Kurt?\", I said, sitting on the counter of my dimly lit apartment.\n\"Yeah.....\", Kurt whispered, laying on the couch fiddling with his mother's creepy death pen, \"I've gotta go.\"\n\"Go where? Your place is trashed, you can't even navigate around in there!\", I said.\n\"I've gotta go, I've gotta go, I can't be here right now.\" Kurt mumbled as he ran out the door.\n\"Ok then.....bye!\" I yelled, but he didn't hear. He was long gone. What was that all about? This morning he's destroying his apartment and literally throwing me out the door, now he's freaking out over nothing at all. It's weird, he was just fine before the news was on. It's not like HE murdered those people or anything. Kurt wouldn't kill an insect, let alone two human beings. Maybe his outbursts are coming back, like when we were kids. But that doesn't make any sense, his freak out sessions were usually an array of Satanic screams and shrieks, not mumbling and busting my records. Maybe he is just having some personal problems he isn't telling me about. I'll just give it some time and call him about it later.\n\n*BEEP*,\"......Hey you almost reached Kurt, sorry you didn't. Leave a message if you want. I can't guarantee I'll have the incentive to get back to you though. Thanks.\" *BEEP*\n\"Kurt? Kurt, I know you're there man, pick up. It's James................alright. Call me when you get home. Please.\" That's the twelfth call I've given him. It's been two days since he stormed out of my house after the news report. I'm really concerned for him right now. It's freaking me out in a big, bad way. That night, and last night as well, eight more people were murdered in the same way as the two unfortunate individuals before. One was unidentified, but was given a physical desription similar to that of Kurt's. Long blond hair, about five foot eleven and one-hundred and forty pounds, an unshaven face, and very light blue eyes. That was his most recognizable physical feature. His piercing, almost white eyes. I hope to God he is ok.\n*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*. I hurried to the door hoping it was him. As I opened the door, I saw before me two rather vicious looking police officers. One towering me in size and looks like he can bench a truck, and the other shorter than me, but still looks like he can put me in intense pain.\n\"Excuse me, are you James Grohl?\" said the short one. The big guy must not be the talker.\n\"Y-yes, that's me. What's wrong, Officer?\" I said, confused at why the cops are here and why they know my name.\n\"It says here that you are good friends with a man named Kurt Noveselic. Is this true?\" said the officer in a dead-pan voice.\n\"Yes, that's correct, we are best friends. What, did he get hurt?\" I said, jumping to that horrible conclusion I sensed coming on.\n\"No, quite the opposite actually. Your friend's fingerprints were found all over the scenes of those murders. We need to locate him right now for some questioning. Can you please disclose his address immedietly?\". What? Kurt's fingerprints all over those scenes? That can't be possible, he isn't a murderer. He can't even kill a good mood. But it would explain his odd distance as of late.\n\"Um.....he actually just moved so I'm not sure where he lives now. I'm sorry.\" I lied, \"Is there any other evidence to prove it?\"\n\"Yes, a slightly chewed up pen cap. Just call the authorities when you find him. Your friend could possibly be a murderer, and you can't let him get away with it.\", the man said with great authority. A pen cap. That is too much of a coincidence. The two policeman left the building and drove off in their vehicle.\n\nI'm going to go over to his house right now. I need to make sure he hasnt finally snapped from years of built up emotion. Part of how he controlled his dim outbursts before was learning how not to show anger or sadness. What happened a couple days ago certainly seemed angry and sad.\nAs I walk up to his apartment door, I notice a slight change in the color hue of the hallways. When I walked into the building, and everytime I've been here before, they were are a bright yellow, like the Sun. Now, as I get closer and closer to his room, I see it go from a cheery yellow to a dark, disturbing, almost rotten yellow the likes of which I've never seen. It's like, the air is a little murkier around this room at all times. I grasped onto the handle, knowing Kurt never locks his door, and immediatly pulled back. It was freezing cold, almost literally frozen. He must have the tempurature at arctic levels in there. I braced myself and sheepishly grabbed the handle again, expecting another cold rush. But this time, it was burning hot. It was even steeming a little. What in the world is happenening in there? How did the temperature change so dramatically in seconds? Now without hesitation, I grabbed the handle and threw the door open. It was completely dark, except for a light shining from what could be a TV coming from Kurt's room. I flipped the switch, but the light didn't come on. I remembered Kurt was too lazy to buy another bulb for his ceiling light, so he freely walked across his house in the dark at night. With a little formal training myself, I easily walked across Kurt's floor. He obviously cleaned up his mess, because I wasn't having trouble at all.\nAs I walked into Kurt's room, I saw the light was indeed from a television. But it was displaying the snowy effect it does when there is no signal. I looked at the floor and saw a can of cold Pepsi, a half-eaten bowl of cereal, and a thick book. It was Kurt's diary. He kept one ever since his mother was killed, and has written in it everytime something eventful happened in his life. I hate to intrude on Kurt's personal things, but if there was ever a good time to invade his privacy, it was now. I looked at the last entry, dated three days ago.\n\"April 23, 1991. I thought I did it years ago. But it turns out Mom was just the first in a string of them. Lord, with your power inside me, I'll rid the World of these pests...\" What? What on Earth does that mean? His mom was the first in a string of what? I read on....., \"Earth doesn't need this evil. I'll do it the way you want, with my pen. The pen you gave me all those years ago. Just like mom, they will feel the pain of all their sins. Kurt.\" As I read the last line, I had a revelation. More, a question. Did Kurt kill his mother? Has he been lying to me all these years, and was his father really a decent, honest man? I have to find him right now. I need to ask him if this means what I think it means. If so....then those cops were right. Kurt is a murderer.\nI left Kurt's apartment in a mix of several different emotions. Pain, grief, sadness, I even cried on my way back to my apartment. My best friend can't be a killer. He just isn't that kind of man. If he did have a problem with someone, he wouldn't kill them. He'd just show off his smart-guy attitude and shrug it off like nothing. He doesn't let somber things get to him. Not after his mother died.......or after he killed her.....I don't even know anymore. I finally made it up the steep steps of my dirty little home.\n\"KURT!\" I screamed, horrified at what was before my very eyes. Blood, everywhere. On the walls, on the carpet, and all over.....him. Kurt was in the dead center of my living room, hunched over a large, decrepid bowl full of blood. He was stirring it, like a witch over it's cauldron. \"Kurt....what the Hell is going on?\"\n\"I couldnt stay at my house, they'll find me there!\" cried Kurt. I knew what he was talking about.\n\"Kurt....I need you to be honest with me. Did.....did you kill those people on the news?\" I asked, afraid of the answer I knew was coming.\n\"Yes, James. Yes, I killed them. They deserved it!\" said Kurt, the last part at the top of his lungs. Kurt never lied, so I knew he would fess to it.\n\"Why?\" I asked. Then, he went nuts.\n\"THEY DESERVED IT!!! They were worshipping Satan, James! I saw them with my own eyes! And....a-and God told me to kill them!\" Kurt bellowed, standing up so fast his bowl of blood almost tipped over. It wouldnt matter, my carpet's already drenched in it. He stalked over to me like I was thin air. \"God gave me this pen, James. H-h-he told m-me to do it. It was God's grace! I couldn't say no!\". I was disgusted at what I was hearing.\n\"I read your diary, Kurt.\" I whispered.\n\"WHAT?? You know how important my privacy is, James!\" Kurt screamed. He threw his spoon on the ground so hard it almost cracked my kitchen tile.\n\"I don't care, Kurt. You killed your mother didn't you?\" I asked with authority.\n\"Yes, bu-\" Kurt began. But I was in no mood for \"but\"'s.\n\"And your father was innocent. You lied to me Kurt. All these years, you have been living a lie. I always gave you pity and excused your crazy behavior, but that was because I thought you witnessed your mother die in cold blood. But now that I know it was by your hand.......I...I just don't know what to say, Kurt. You aren't speaking to God.\" I said, slightly hurt by my own words. But I meant it. I always dismissed his actions because I thought he was innocently a little loopy in the head. But it was his own fault he's insane\n\"......What....what did you say?\" Kurt asked. I was a little taken back by his sudden authority, \"You sound like one of them, Jimmy. A Satanist.\" Kurt whispered, his eyes the palest I've ever seen them. How he concluded that I'm a satanist is a mystery.\n\"Kurt, for God's sake....\"\n\"YES!! For God's sake!......\" He gave me a weird, hound dog like sniff on the chest. Then, he pulled out his pen. \".....for God's sake.\" He cocked his hand back very slowly.\n\"Kurt....what are you doing??\" I asked, scared stiff.\n\"James, James, James.

Only 2 or 3 educated. I weighed around 12st/160lb/76Kg when I started training at 16 years old and got to around 15st/210lb/95.2kg by the end of my first year got really strong but also put on a lot of fat. I mean a lot. Into my 2nd year I decided I would try to shred but instead of sorting out my diet I started to just do weights 3 times a week and cardio 3 times a week. Not knowing in hindsight that cardio would slow down my already dysfunctional metabolism and I continued to put on more weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I needed to lose weight so I stopped doing weights and mind numbing cardio and returned to boxing for about 8 months and started to get my diet in check. I slowly lost weight until I weighed in at around 14st/196lb when I had a wrist injury and lost interest in boxing and went back to the gym at about 18 years old and a little bit wiser to training. Started eating really well/healthy, and started a nice split routine on 4 days a week. About 2 months in and I was making really good progress losing fat and increasing mass. One day when training I managed to tear my rotator cuff. This put me out of training anything for nearly 6months whilst attending physiotherapy sessions. So whilst out of training my mind wondered elsewhere and I begun to eat junk and well I got very annoyed with the fact that I couldn’t train so I did the opposite and started eating really badly whilst my shoulder healed, thinking I willl be okay when I start training again….I was wrong.\n Once my shoulder healed it turned out I had healed out of placement in which meant my shoulder didn&amp;#39;t match the other side. I began training other muscle groups except from chest and shoulders as it put too much strain on the muscle and would burn out really quickly. On these days except from training the muscle directly I would perform form changing exercises and supporting muscle movements. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings me to about 10months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My shoulder had healed and was feeling strong I had put on a lot of weight and at 17st.8/113kg/249lb was ready to start training &amp;quot;properly&amp;quot; again… actually  I was just going to train correctly for the first time. One thing an injury will do is help you become educated about what not to do. I began with my diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diet\nI knew that to change your body to reach your goals you will need to change your diet to that of what your body will be representing. I always believed that I would need to go from A-B when dieting, A being your current diet routines to B the diet routines of that of a person who looks like a superhero. Sadly we don’t live in a world where a single bite of radioactive spider will give you a six pack. What I did find is that the way I managed to stick to my new “lifestyle” choices when approaching food was to change my diet in stages. This went as follows;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A.  Renouncing Junk. This was the easiest step to change for me, I stopped ordering Pizza’s, local Chinese and Indian takeaways and switched up to home-made substitutes when feeling the urge to indulge in stodgy fast food. (Mostly awaited for a weekend treat)\nThe stage above lasted for 2 weeks until I moved on to the next stage of my lifestyle choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B.  Portion control: During this stage I basically took what were massive plates full of food to fist sized portions of each of the food groups. This was; one fist of protein, one fist of carbs and two fists of vegetables.\nThis stage I kept on for about 6 weeks until I moved on to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C.  Carb Back loading: as you will see from my pictures this was the most successful in tearing away the fat. You guys may agree that for my endomorph body type and the progress from months 3-6 was probably the most substantial in terms of fat loss. The science behind this is that I personally have a high insulin response in the morning. This meant that for when I was taking in carbs in the morning or at least until after lunchtime I would more than likely store the carbs as fat instead of using them as energy. Sadly it’s just the way I am wired.\nThe surprising thing to me about carb back-loading was that although the first couple of weeks of the back loading was tiresome, once my body had gotten used to this way of eating I felt like I had even more energy than prior to cutting out carbs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a week into back-loading I increased my meal frequency to help with energy levels and to increase metabolism. This in itself was a step I was going to take once the back-loading took effect, but due to tiredness I felt it necessary to start taking in food as often as possible.\nD.  Meal Frequency: I simply added a meal in between breakfast, lunch, dinner and then a post workout shake.\nI did this up to about month 4 until moving on to the final stage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E.  Protein variation, carb strict and fat intake increases: This is the stage I continue up to even this day. I started to make sure I was getting variable proteins in my diet through supplementation and eating different meats for every meal (Except for double chicken day). I restricted my carbs in meals to only having carbs for 3 meals a week. And ensuring when I did have carbs it was in the form of sweet potato, whole grains etc. I was making sure to get the correct fats into my diet be it, specially formulated peanut butter with low sugar, fatty fishes and extra virgin oils and butters when cooking. \nSome other things to mention is that I drank nothing but water throughout this whole “Lifestyle change” and continue to do so and when I started to do weights I added about 400 calories through extra protein. I have now started upping the carbs into everyday just for my evening post workout meal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example of my daily diet I will be posted below with my full week split, food and supplementation example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training\nSo that’s my diet sorted I’ll explain my training throughout the 10 months so far.\nMonths 1-3\nHIIT I started off doing high intensity circuits, where I would do 3 minutes 70% effort on a cardio machine, skipping rope or boxing bag to a circuit of body weight exercises such as squats, push ups chins and rope climbs. I would train for around 45mins doing each made up circuit for 3 cycles and rest for 3 minutes.\nExamples of this are;\nBoxing bag 3 mins push ups, squats\nRowing machine 3 mins, chins, squats\nRunning machine 3 mins, rope pulls squats\nI tried to use my whole body throughout the sessions.\nMonths 3-6\nI continued doing HIIT on 3 days a week focusing on cardio based exercises and did superset workouts with light to medium weight on the other 3 days.\nMonday, I did Chest and Bi’s super setting a chest movement with a biceps movement (4 sets between 12 and 18 reps on each exercise.)\nTuesday, 2mins boxing bag, 2 mins running, 2mins boxing bag, 2 mins skipping cycle until I had been in the gym for 45 mins –hour\nWednesday, legs and abs same style as Monday (Shoulder support work added for 20 mins)\nThursday, 2mins rowing, 2mins skipping, 2mins rowing, 2mins running 45mins –hour \nFriday, back and tri’s same style as Monday and Wednesday\nSaturday, same as Tuesday (shoulder support work added for 20 mins)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months 6-10\nI had lost enough weight in my opinion to start doing weights properly again. My shoulder felt stronger and I had experienced a lot less pain from it over this extended period of time. In honesty I was looking at starting to try and lift weight coming up to the 6 months mark and my strength had nearly halved on all my lifts from when I was a lot larger (obviously HIIT was going to do this). So.... demoralised with my “Progress” or at that point my digression in strength I had to ask myself….”Do I even lift bro” so from then on I decided to hit the weights again. I knew my muscle memory would kick in at some point and I would get back the muscle and strength I had previously, but the hell would I know what my body looked like underneath all that fat so when my muscles started to respond and I remembered “I do even lift” I was chuffed with the results. About month 8 I was already nearly approaching my old PB’s and was happy with the progress. I think that my body may have begun to plateau with weight loss through HIIT and I came off just in time, I went on to run a split routine weight lifting workout. When lifting weights at a higher weight your body’s metabolism increases even more so I continued to lose weight and build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As promised earlier here is my then and current split routine. I only change the types of exercises I do every fortnight to try and stop plateau. This helps me keep an eye on progression and keeps my body on its toes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Split Routine;\nI get up at 6:00 AM have a coffee to do my fasted cardio before breakfast and start work between 8am-8:30am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday, AM: 45mins fasted power walk PM: Chest. 10 mins light cardio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, AM: 45mins fasted Bike ride PM: Legs &amp;amp; Abs. 10 mins light cardio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, AM: 45mins fasted power walk PM: Bi’s and Tri’s. 10 mins light cardio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday, AM: 45mins fasted Bike ride PM: Shoulders &amp;amp; Traps. 10 mins light cardio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday, AM: 45mins fasted power walk PM: Back and Abs. 10 mins light cardio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday, 45 minute light cardio&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday rest&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Diet and Supps;\nDaily I usually supplement with each meal\n7AM: 4BCAA, 2CLA\n10AM: 2 Omega 3, 1 A-Z Multi Vitamin, 5g Creatine monohydrate\n12PM: 4BCAA, 1 Green Tea Extract\n3PM: 2 Raspberry Ketone\n5PM: 4BCAA, 1 Cod liver oil\n7:30PM: 4BCAA\n9:30PM: Zinc and magnesium&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday: \n7am 3 eggs scrambled. 10am low carb protein shake. 12pm 2 breasts of chicken half plate of peas carrots and corn mix. 3pm oats and nuts. 5pm tbl spoon of peanut butter off the spoon and pre workout drink.

Post workout fillet steak sweet potato and spinach. Half hour before bed bedtime fuel slow releasing protein shake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday (4 meals, normally get a little relaxed on the frequency but make each meal slightly bigger. I feel it must help kick start my metabolism through the week):\nWhen I wake up scrambled eggs, lunch anything high in protein and something with good fibre so usually a chicken and bacon carbonara pasta with brown/wholemeal/gluten free pasta. Home-made chicken korma or Rogan josh curry. Bedtime fuel protien shake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday 4 meals( heavier “Cheat”meals): For a cheat that’s not a cheat pick vegetarian “Bad Foods” they are much better for you and the quality has improved in recent years.\nWhen I wake up 5 scrambled egg omelette with ham and cheese. Lunch vegetarian mozzerella burgers, sweet potato wedges and a protein cookie. dinner time Home-made pizza or I like to sometimes have like 20 veggie chicken nuggets and normal chips. Small ben and jerry’s ice cream and a bedtime fuel shake with added chocolate nesquik. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have made a tried some good &amp;quot;cheat meals&amp;quot; that makes me feel I have gotten some of my favourite meals with actual health benefits.\nSome of these include;\nBangers and Mash. I would change of for vegetarian sausages that are high in protein and have sweet potato mash. (loves me some sweet potatos)\nBurger and chips. vegetarian mozzarella burgers in wholemeal bun (not sure if I can mention brands but there&amp;#39;s plenty out there), sweet potato wedges.\nHome-made pizza. I like meaty pizzas, I would normally go for a gluten free pizza base and make it with deli picked out ham and pepperoni, add mozzarella and add parmesan for extra cheese. parmesan is good for healthy muscle growth!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;List goes on but I thought its worth to mention a few as it helped me stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached a point about 6 weeks ago where I was fluctuating in weight between 14st.12lb/197lb/89kg and 15st.2lb/212lb/96kg. This point I thought I was going nowhere but I actually dropped a belt size during the time.

Only 2 or 3 educated. I weighed around 12st/160lb/76Kg when I started training at 16 years old and got to around 15st/210lb/95.2kg by the end of my first year got really strong but also put on a lot of fat. I mean a lot. Into my 2nd year I decided I would try to shred but instead of sorting out my diet I started to just do weights 3 times a week and cardio 3 times a week. Not knowing in hindsight that cardio would slow down my already dysfunctional metabolism and I continued to put on more weight.\n\nI knew I needed to lose weight so I stopped doing weights and mind numbing cardio and returned to boxing for about 8 months and started to get my diet in check. I slowly lost weight until I weighed in at around 14st/196lb when I had a wrist injury and lost interest in boxing and went back to the gym at about 18 years old and a little bit wiser to training. Started eating really well/healthy, and started a nice split routine on 4 days a week. About 2 months in and I was making really good progress losing fat and increasing mass. One day when training I managed to tear my rotator cuff. This put me out of training anything for nearly 6months whilst attending physiotherapy sessions. So whilst out of training my mind wondered elsewhere and I begun to eat junk and well I got very annoyed with the fact that I couldn’t train so I did the opposite and started eating really badly whilst my shoulder healed, thinking I willl be okay when I start training again….I was wrong.\n Once my shoulder healed it turned out I had healed out of placement in which meant my shoulder didn't match the other side. I began training other muscle groups except from chest and shoulders as it put too much strain on the muscle and would burn out really quickly. On these days except from training the muscle directly I would perform form changing exercises and supporting muscle movements. \n\nThis brings me to about 10months ago.\n\nMy shoulder had healed and was feeling strong I had put on a lot of weight and at 17st.8/113kg/249lb was ready to start training \"properly\" again… actually  I was just going to train correctly for the first time. One thing an injury will do is help you become educated about what not to do. I began with my diet.\n\n\n\nDiet\nI knew that to change your body to reach your goals you will need to change your diet to that of what your body will be representing. I always believed that I would need to go from A-B when dieting, A being your current diet routines to B the diet routines of that of a person who looks like a superhero. Sadly we don’t live in a world where a single bite of radioactive spider will give you a six pack. What I did find is that the way I managed to stick to my new “lifestyle” choices when approaching food was to change my diet in stages. This went as follows;\n\nA.\tRenouncing Junk. This was the easiest step to change for me, I stopped ordering Pizza’s, local Chinese and Indian takeaways and switched up to home-made substitutes when feeling the urge to indulge in stodgy fast food. (Mostly awaited for a weekend treat)\nThe stage above lasted for 2 weeks until I moved on to the next stage of my lifestyle choice.\n\nB.\tPortion control: During this stage I basically took what were massive plates full of food to fist sized portions of each of the food groups. This was; one fist of protein, one fist of carbs and two fists of vegetables.\nThis stage I kept on for about 6 weeks until I moved on to the next stage.\n\nC.\tCarb Back loading: as you will see from my pictures this was the most successful in tearing away the fat. You guys may agree that for my endomorph body type and the progress from months 3-6 was probably the most substantial in terms of fat loss. The science behind this is that I personally have a high insulin response in the morning. This meant that for when I was taking in carbs in the morning or at least until after lunchtime I would more than likely store the carbs as fat instead of using them as energy. Sadly it’s just the way I am wired.\nThe surprising thing to me about carb back-loading was that although the first couple of weeks of the back loading was tiresome, once my body had gotten used to this way of eating I felt like I had even more energy than prior to cutting out carbs. \n\nAbout a week into back-loading I increased my meal frequency to help with energy levels and to increase metabolism. This in itself was a step I was going to take once the back-loading took effect, but due to tiredness I felt it necessary to start taking in food as often as possible.\nD.\tMeal Frequency: I simply added a meal in between breakfast, lunch, dinner and then a post workout shake.\nI did this up to about month 4 until moving on to the final stage.\n\nE.\tProtein variation, carb strict and fat intake increases: This is the stage I continue up to even this day. I started to make sure I was getting variable proteins in my diet through supplementation and eating different meats for every meal (Except for double chicken day). I restricted my carbs in meals to only having carbs for 3 meals a week. And ensuring when I did have carbs it was in the form of sweet potato, whole grains etc. I was making sure to get the correct fats into my diet be it, specially formulated peanut butter with low sugar, fatty fishes and extra virgin oils and butters when cooking. \nSome other things to mention is that I drank nothing but water throughout this whole “Lifestyle change” and continue to do so and when I started to do weights I added about 400 calories through extra protein. I have now started upping the carbs into everyday just for my evening post workout meal.\n\nAn example of my daily diet I will be posted below with my full week split, food and supplementation example.\n\n\nTraining\nSo that’s my diet sorted I’ll explain my training throughout the 10 months so far.\nMonths 1-3\nHIIT I started off doing high intensity circuits, where I would do 3 minutes 70% effort on a cardio machine, skipping rope or boxing bag to a circuit of body weight exercises such as squats, push ups chins and rope climbs. I would train for around 45mins doing each made up circuit for 3 cycles and rest for 3 minutes.\nExamples of this are;\nBoxing bag 3 mins push ups, squats\nRowing machine 3 mins, chins, squats\nRunning machine 3 mins, rope pulls squats\nI tried to use my whole body throughout the sessions.\nMonths 3-6\nI continued doing HIIT on 3 days a week focusing on cardio based exercises and did superset workouts with light to medium weight on the other 3 days.\nMonday, I did Chest and Bi’s super setting a chest movement with a biceps movement (4 sets between 12 and 18 reps on each exercise.)\nTuesday, 2mins boxing bag, 2 mins running, 2mins boxing bag, 2 mins skipping cycle until I had been in the gym for 45 mins –hour\nWednesday, legs and abs same style as Monday (Shoulder support work added for 20 mins)\nThursday, 2mins rowing, 2mins skipping, 2mins rowing, 2mins running 45mins –hour \nFriday, back and tri’s same style as Monday and Wednesday\nSaturday, same as Tuesday (shoulder support work added for 20 mins)\n\n\n\nMonths 6-10\nI had lost enough weight in my opinion to start doing weights properly again. My shoulder felt stronger and I had experienced a lot less pain from it over this extended period of time. In honesty I was looking at starting to try and lift weight coming up to the 6 months mark and my strength had nearly halved on all my lifts from when I was a lot larger (obviously HIIT was going to do this). So.... demoralised with my “Progress” or at that point my digression in strength I had to ask myself….”Do I even lift bro” so from then on I decided to hit the weights again. I knew my muscle memory would kick in at some point and I would get back the muscle and strength I had previously, but the hell would I know what my body looked like underneath all that fat so when my muscles started to respond and I remembered “I do even lift” I was chuffed with the results. About month 8 I was already nearly approaching my old PB’s and was happy with the progress. I think that my body may have begun to plateau with weight loss through HIIT and I came off just in time, I went on to run a split routine weight lifting workout. When lifting weights at a higher weight your body’s metabolism increases even more so I continued to lose weight and build muscle.\n\nAs promised earlier here is my then and current split routine. I only change the types of exercises I do every fortnight to try and stop plateau. This helps me keep an eye on progression and keeps my body on its toes.  \n\nSplit Routine;\nI get up at 6:00 AM have a coffee to do my fasted cardio before breakfast and start work between 8am-8:30am.\n\nMonday, AM: 45mins fasted power walk PM: Chest. 10 mins light cardio\n\nTuesday, AM: 45mins fasted Bike ride PM: Legs &amp; Abs. 10 mins light cardio\n\nWednesday, AM: 45mins fasted power walk PM: Bi’s and Tri’s. 10 mins light cardio\n\nThursday, AM: 45mins fasted Bike ride PM: Shoulders &amp; Traps. 10 mins light cardio\n\nFriday, AM: 45mins fasted power walk PM: Back and Abs. 10 mins light cardio\n\nSaturday, 45 minute light cardio\n\nSunday rest\n\nDiet and Supps;\nDaily I usually supplement with each meal\n7AM: 4BCAA, 2CLA\n10AM: 2 Omega 3, 1 A-Z Multi Vitamin, 5g Creatine monohydrate\n12PM: 4BCAA, 1 Green Tea Extract\n3PM: 2 Raspberry Ketone\n5PM: 4BCAA, 1 Cod liver oil\n7:30PM: 4BCAA\n9:30PM: Zinc and magnesium\n\nMonday: \n7am 3 eggs scrambled. 10am low carb protein shake. 12pm 2 breasts of chicken half plate of peas carrots and corn mix. 3pm oats and nuts. 5pm tbl spoon of peanut butter off the spoon and pre workout drink. Post workout, Tuna steak, sweet potato, and broccoli.

Half hour before bed bedtime fuel slow releasing protein shake.\n\nThursday:\n7am: 4eggs Scrambled. 10am low carb protein shake. 12pm 2 breast of chicken half plate of carrots and green beans. 3pm protein cookie. 5pm pre workout. Post workout Salmon, sweet potato and broccoli. Half hour before bed bedtime fuel slow releasing protein shake.\n\nFriday:\n7am: 2eggs Scrambled. 10am low carb protein shake. 12pm 2 breast of chicken half plate of mixed veg. 3pm nuts and oats. 5pm tbl spoon of peanut butter off the spoon and pre workout. Post workout fillet steak sweet potato and spinach. Half hour before bed bedtime fuel slow releasing protein shake.\n\nSaturday (4 meals, normally get a little relaxed on the frequency but make each meal slightly bigger. I feel it must help kick start my metabolism through the week):\nWhen I wake up scrambled eggs, lunch anything high in protein and something with good fibre so usually a chicken and bacon carbonara pasta with brown/wholemeal/gluten free pasta. Home-made chicken korma or Rogan josh curry. Bedtime fuel protien shake.\n\nSunday 4 meals( heavier “Cheat”meals): For a cheat that’s not a cheat pick vegetarian “Bad Foods” they are much better for you and the quality has improved in recent years.\nWhen I wake up 5 scrambled egg omelette with ham and cheese. Lunch vegetarian mozzerella burgers, sweet potato wedges and a protein cookie. dinner time Home-made pizza or I like to sometimes have like 20 veggie chicken nuggets and normal chips. Small ben and jerry’s ice cream and a bedtime fuel shake with added chocolate nesquik. \n\nI have made a tried some good \"cheat meals\" that makes me feel I have gotten some of my favourite meals with actual health benefits.\nSome of these include;\nBangers and Mash. I would change of for vegetarian sausages that are high in protein and have sweet potato mash. (loves me some sweet potatos)\nBurger and chips. vegetarian mozzarella burgers in wholemeal bun (not sure if I can mention brands but there's plenty out there), sweet potato wedges.\nHome-made pizza. I like meaty pizzas, I would normally go for a gluten free pizza base and make it with deli picked out ham and pepperoni, add mozzarella and add parmesan for extra cheese. parmesan is good for healthy muscle growth!\n\nList goes on but I thought its worth to mention a few as it helped me stay on track.\n\nI reached a point about 6 weeks ago where I was fluctuating in weight between 14st.12lb/197lb/89kg and 15st.2lb/212lb/96kg. This point I thought I was going nowhere but I actually dropped a belt size during the time. I would say that my belt whole puncture was a good way of measuring my progress without getting out the tape every week.\n\nI am planning on moving on to Mike Ohearns power bodybuilding to improve my lifts and continue gaining muscle\nMy end game goal would be to have 12% bodyfat and join the 1000lb club.

Not just the big question. The little question. Why are we gathered here today?  What is the relationship between these questions? What is the difference in perspective between the big and little “why are we here?”?  Is it unfair to say that it is only a matter of perspective?  I ask that you take this moment to take three deep breaths with me. It occurred to me to jokingly ask how many breaths I could get out of this audience, or how many collective breaths there are until the bloc of 20 minutes is up and whether or not that might provide a larger benefit to the audience than the rest of this paper.[i] And I think this is a good paper. We need to take more care in our understanding of broader conceptions, especially those with pretensions because of the increasing complexity involved as scale increases, and I will try to tie together why we are here as philosophers with why we are here at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us start small. You presumably chose to be here, to listen/read. Hopefully you had some good reasons. If the conceptual objects being sustained in your thought stream now are intensely personal, striking to the core of how your identity is defined, good for you. Philosophy is as philosophy does. What is a philosopher other than one who philosophizes. It certainly is not the paycheck or the pedigree that makes the philosopher lest we omit greats like Socrates, arguably the father of western philosophy. But really this is just a rationalization, confabulatory even. We do not really know why we are here. We do not really know what compels us to write and listen. No you say, I had good reason to be here. It was this, that, and the other thing. But who or what determined the value you fundamentally place on the smallest units of your decision making process? It could not be the conscious you. Whence has your rubric come? From what source do you derive your orienting values?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surely we will want to be as accurate as possible. We will want our assessments to be meaningfully true, to represent fairly what we might call objective reality. I am going to assume that I am not a figment in your imagination and that you are not a figment in mine, and that therefore a reality exists independently of your or my awareness of it. Given then that we seem to be little tiny bits of reality, it should be rather uncontroversial to say that reality or existence is vastly greater than any one of us at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we want to be confident that something is true then it is easier if what we are trying to test or verify is first, verifiable even in principle, and furthermore more limited in scope than not. It can be safely said that the more limited the scope of the question the more likely we are to agree on the veracity of any particular answer. Without resorting to doing violence to the common meanings of the words we use, the vast majority of us would be compelled to agree to and even attest to the truth of a rather large number  statements, many of which would be rather trivially so, like this piece of paper is white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think  these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire lives, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? How does this repercuss, so to speak? There is a clear difference between certitude and certainty. Let us try not to confuse the former for the latter. Let us practice withholding final judgments and be humble and tentative in our metaphysical speculations. How does such a stance take shape? If most of what we think we know, is exactly that, what we think we know, not what we actually know; if much of what we “know” is wrong or unfounded, what do we know or what can we know? We know for example that we cannot trust revelation[ii], and that belief in supernatural agency is more explicable than supernatural agency itself. Just like the childhood belief in the boogeyman is more explicable than the existence of an actual boogeyman. All supernatural belief is speculative. As such, it is entirely inappropriate to take seriously any of the various claims to a monopoly on Truth (with a capital “T”). We certainly know that eliminationist rhetoric, promoting the conclusion of a debate by physically eliminating the opposition is wrong. In fact, it seems we need the exact opposite. Exactly because we are so limited, so prone to error, and so talented in “knowing” we are the ones that are right, that caring about the actual truth requires us to place the utmost value on evidence, dissent and disagreement to give us a chance to be less wrong collectively. As Richard Feynman said, “the first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as a species, we have jury-rigged some workaround systems in seeking arenas of accountability, the most successful of which appear to be science, democracy, courts, and markets. Unfortunately it is increasingly clear that as markets became distorted by the oligarchical power of increasingly consolidated multinational corporations an era of high corruption was soon to follow with consequences in the operation and perception of each of the four accountability arenas. I have written and spoken elsewhere on the known uncertainties and certainties addressing our species collectively and our duty as American and global citizens to become more politically aware and engaged as our political class gets away with torture and mass murder[iii], the gap between scientific and public opinion on key issues like global warming continue to grow[iv], and the American Dream circles the toilet drain.[v] So we will assume temporarily that our serious problems as a nation and species will go away on their own, perhaps abetted by the exponential acceleration of technological development and ignore the call to actively stand with our brothers and sisters in Egypt standing up to authoritarian power there as Americans  probably should here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will forego then what might be considered the most pragmatic approach (let’s do something right now). Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tremendous opportunity exists. Science has become the clear leader in building the broadest possible consensus of rational thought, mapping and explaining the world around us with the fewest possible assumptions. But it is  humble and abashed. Good scientists abound and constantly fret about overstating their case or making specific policy prescriptions for fear of tarnishing their reputations as scientists and being no longer seen as the pursuers of truth no matter which way it leads, as they so strive to be. We need to take science and scientists seriously. And apparently they need our help. We need to forcefully make the normative claims that many opine science is incapable of making, as if, the truth, i.e. what has been consistently and reliably shown to be the case, were not relevant in deciding what we should do and how we should behave as individuals and as a species. I have said elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“William James argues that rather than believe nothing he would rather be duped repeatedly in the hope each time that he’s been blessed with knowledge. I would argue that each time William James or anyone else really believes an incorrect belief, in doing so they make it less likely that they will be able to recognize a different hypothesis or theory that better aligns itself with the evidence. To make a computer analogy, religious belief is outdated software.a The inconsistency with the external world is combated by mechanisms specifically evolved to banish conflicting facts or alternative views because in some cases they are considered “of the devil”. In fact, contrary to the James’s implication that beliefs often cycle, the opposite tendency is so strong that there is a saying in science that it progresses one death at a time. As the rate of technological development increases, wisdom becomes more salient and the ability to change our society to fit the world more important. To reiterate then one of the primary benefits of Clifford at James’ expense, it is not solely the content of belief that matters, but the rigidity with which it is held.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, but where does uncertainty get us? Uncertainty gets us all sorts of goodies, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?”[vi]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to find where we as individuals fit in an ecological understanding of philosophy and where philosophy fits in the ecology of knowledge, society and human survival. Way back when, Nietzsche foretold the death of God, when society would no longer be able to ground itself in absolutes. The time is long overdue to take non-tautological/non-mathematical absolutes for what they are, remnants of God. With advances in our understanding like evolution and fractal geometry we can see quite clearly how complexity (even infinite complexity) can arise from iterations of relatively simple algorithms and that this makes resorting to a divine creator in our descriptive understanding of the universe intellectually superfluous at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The religious amongst us most of all seem to be entirely ignorant of the history of religious belief and how it has changed through time. First the gods were everywhere and as humans explored, gods retreated to the mountaintops, and then to the sky, and finally by the time we realized that our planet is a lonely speck in a vast cosmos God retreated into an abstract transcendent realm. Regardless of the fact that God has always been an “of the gaps” variety, this is quite fine by me, I do not see much of a difference between pantheism and atheism in how the universe they describe would look, but there is possibly a related but non-dependent psychological difference between being alone and being alone together. It might be easier as a practical matter to implement and sustain a healthy reverence for life and existence from a pantheist or Spinozan perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I see less and less import from a pragmatic point of view in quibbling about the existence of God. God is a sentiment. A sentiment like any other lens or ideology progressively less amenable to change through reason as we age.[vii] I am entirely comfortable siding with some of the great mystics and spiritual teachers against the tribal fundamentalists of all religions. We can reach people we otherwise would not be able to if we can talk to them in a language of a God that we can show them they do not understand; speaking of God in the Einsteinian sense and indistinguishable from reality or the entirety of existence.[viii] God is the sum total of everything, and the sum total of everything is by definition a mystery to any limited creature. [ix]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since at least James’ The Varieties of Religious Experience it must have been quite clear to many that religious dogma makes rather many more claims than the religious feeling upon which it is founded. That people have experiences that make them feel like the existence of God is undeniably true seems undeniably true. That any of these experiences should be interpreted to support the biblical notion that a woman who is not a virgin on her wedding night should be stoned to death is patently ridiculous.[x] In fact it should be as transparently ridiculous that any of these experiences should be taken to support the truth of any one particular religion, however psychologically understandable it might be that people would take their anecdotal evidence of divinity as support for whatever unprovable mutually exclusive doctrine they were inculcated with as children.[xi] The tragicomic end to many debates with the religious of North America is the evocation, when reason has failed them, of “God works in mysterious ways.” This seems to be a rather crucial juncture to arrive at, because if it is in fact the case that God works in mysterious ways then the faithful should be forced to openly confess that they do not in fact know that any of their religious claims are true. If magic is real then all bets are off. We are as unable to distinguish between competing religious images of God when positing her existence as when we more parsimoniously view existence without the need to assume divine intervention. As William James once said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“the logical reason of man operates in this field of divinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds arguments for our conviction, for indeed it HAS to find them. It amplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and plausibility.

Not just the big question. The little question. Why are we gathered here today?  What is the relationship between these questions? What is the difference in perspective between the big and little “why are we here?”?  Is it unfair to say that it is only a matter of perspective?  I ask that you take this moment to take three deep breaths with me. It occurred to me to jokingly ask how many breaths I could get out of this audience, or how many collective breaths there are until the bloc of 20 minutes is up and whether or not that might provide a larger benefit to the audience than the rest of this paper.[i] And I think this is a good paper. We need to take more care in our understanding of broader conceptions, especially those with pretensions because of the increasing complexity involved as scale increases, and I will try to tie together why we are here as philosophers with why we are here at all.\n\nLet us start small. You presumably chose to be here, to listen/read. Hopefully you had some good reasons. If the conceptual objects being sustained in your thought stream now are intensely personal, striking to the core of how your identity is defined, good for you. Philosophy is as philosophy does. What is a philosopher other than one who philosophizes. It certainly is not the paycheck or the pedigree that makes the philosopher lest we omit greats like Socrates, arguably the father of western philosophy. But really this is just a rationalization, confabulatory even. We do not really know why we are here. We do not really know what compels us to write and listen. No you say, I had good reason to be here. It was this, that, and the other thing. But who or what determined the value you fundamentally place on the smallest units of your decision making process? It could not be the conscious you. Whence has your rubric come? From what source do you derive your orienting values?\n\nSurely we will want to be as accurate as possible. We will want our assessments to be meaningfully true, to represent fairly what we might call objective reality. I am going to assume that I am not a figment in your imagination and that you are not a figment in mine, and that therefore a reality exists independently of your or my awareness of it. Given then that we seem to be little tiny bits of reality, it should be rather uncontroversial to say that reality or existence is vastly greater than any one of us at the moment.\n\nIf we want to be confident that something is true then it is easier if what we are trying to test or verify is first, verifiable even in principle, and furthermore more limited in scope than not. It can be safely said that the more limited the scope of the question the more likely we are to agree on the veracity of any particular answer. Without resorting to doing violence to the common meanings of the words we use, the vast majority of us would be compelled to agree to and even attest to the truth of a rather large number  statements, many of which would be rather trivially so, like this piece of paper is white.\n\nThe class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think  these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire lives, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.\n\nWhat does this mean? How does this repercuss, so to speak? There is a clear difference between certitude and certainty. Let us try not to confuse the former for the latter. Let us practice withholding final judgments and be humble and tentative in our metaphysical speculations. How does such a stance take shape? If most of what we think we know, is exactly that, what we think we know, not what we actually know; if much of what we “know” is wrong or unfounded, what do we know or what can we know? We know for example that we cannot trust revelation[ii], and that belief in supernatural agency is more explicable than supernatural agency itself. Just like the childhood belief in the boogeyman is more explicable than the existence of an actual boogeyman. All supernatural belief is speculative. As such, it is entirely inappropriate to take seriously any of the various claims to a monopoly on Truth (with a capital “T”). We certainly know that eliminationist rhetoric, promoting the conclusion of a debate by physically eliminating the opposition is wrong. In fact, it seems we need the exact opposite. Exactly because we are so limited, so prone to error, and so talented in “knowing” we are the ones that are right, that caring about the actual truth requires us to place the utmost value on evidence, dissent and disagreement to give us a chance to be less wrong collectively. As Richard Feynman said, “the first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.\"\n\nFortunately, as a species, we have jury-rigged some workaround systems in seeking arenas of accountability, the most successful of which appear to be science, democracy, courts, and markets. Unfortunately it is increasingly clear that as markets became distorted by the oligarchical power of increasingly consolidated multinational corporations an era of high corruption was soon to follow with consequences in the operation and perception of each of the four accountability arenas. I have written and spoken elsewhere on the known uncertainties and certainties addressing our species collectively and our duty as American and global citizens to become more politically aware and engaged as our political class gets away with torture and mass murder[iii], the gap between scientific and public opinion on key issues like global warming continue to grow[iv], and the American Dream circles the toilet drain.[v] So we will assume temporarily that our serious problems as a nation and species will go away on their own, perhaps abetted by the exponential acceleration of technological development and ignore the call to actively stand with our brothers and sisters in Egypt standing up to authoritarian power there as Americans  probably should here.\n\nWe will forego then what might be considered the most pragmatic approach (let’s do something right now). Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together.\n\nA tremendous opportunity exists. Science has become the clear leader in building the broadest possible consensus of rational thought, mapping and explaining the world around us with the fewest possible assumptions. But it is  humble and abashed. Good scientists abound and constantly fret about overstating their case or making specific policy prescriptions for fear of tarnishing their reputations as scientists and being no longer seen as the pursuers of truth no matter which way it leads, as they so strive to be. We need to take science and scientists seriously. And apparently they need our help. We need to forcefully make the normative claims that many opine science is incapable of making, as if, the truth, i.e. what has been consistently and reliably shown to be the case, were not relevant in deciding what we should do and how we should behave as individuals and as a species. I have said elsewhere:\n\n“William James argues that rather than believe nothing he would rather be duped repeatedly in the hope each time that he’s been blessed with knowledge. I would argue that each time William James or anyone else really believes an incorrect belief, in doing so they make it less likely that they will be able to recognize a different hypothesis or theory that better aligns itself with the evidence. To make a computer analogy, religious belief is outdated software.a The inconsistency with the external world is combated by mechanisms specifically evolved to banish conflicting facts or alternative views because in some cases they are considered “of the devil”. In fact, contrary to the James’s implication that beliefs often cycle, the opposite tendency is so strong that there is a saying in science that it progresses one death at a time. As the rate of technological development increases, wisdom becomes more salient and the ability to change our society to fit the world more important. To reiterate then one of the primary benefits of Clifford at James’ expense, it is not solely the content of belief that matters, but the rigidity with which it is held.\n\nDogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, but where does uncertainty get us? Uncertainty gets us all sorts of goodies, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?”[vi]\n\nWe need to find where we as individuals fit in an ecological understanding of philosophy and where philosophy fits in the ecology of knowledge, society and human survival. Way back when, Nietzsche foretold the death of God, when society would no longer be able to ground itself in absolutes. The time is long overdue to take non-tautological/non-mathematical absolutes for what they are, remnants of God. With advances in our understanding like evolution and fractal geometry we can see quite clearly how complexity (even infinite complexity) can arise from iterations of relatively simple algorithms and that this makes resorting to a divine creator in our descriptive understanding of the universe intellectually superfluous at best.\n\nThe religious amongst us most of all seem to be entirely ignorant of the history of religious belief and how it has changed through time. First the gods were everywhere and as humans explored, gods retreated to the mountaintops, and then to the sky, and finally by the time we realized that our planet is a lonely speck in a vast cosmos God retreated into an abstract transcendent realm. Regardless of the fact that God has always been an “of the gaps” variety, this is quite fine by me, I do not see much of a difference between pantheism and atheism in how the universe they describe would look, but there is possibly a related but non-dependent psychological difference between being alone and being alone together. It might be easier as a practical matter to implement and sustain a healthy reverence for life and existence from a pantheist or Spinozan perspective.\n\nHowever, I see less and less import from a pragmatic point of view in quibbling about the existence of God. God is a sentiment. A sentiment like any other lens or ideology progressively less amenable to change through reason as we age.[vii] I am entirely comfortable siding with some of the great mystics and spiritual teachers against the tribal fundamentalists of all religions. We can reach people we otherwise would not be able to if we can talk to them in a language of a God that we can show them they do not understand; speaking of God in the Einsteinian sense and indistinguishable from reality or the entirety of existence.[viii] God is the sum total of everything, and the sum total of everything is by definition a mystery to any limited creature. [ix]\n\nSince at least James’ The Varieties of Religious Experience it must have been quite clear to many that religious dogma makes rather many more claims than the religious feeling upon which it is founded. That people have experiences that make them feel like the existence of God is undeniably true seems undeniably true. That any of these experiences should be interpreted to support the biblical notion that a woman who is not a virgin on her wedding night should be stoned to death is patently ridiculous.[x] In fact it should be as transparently ridiculous that any of these experiences should be taken to support the truth of any one particular religion, however psychologically understandable it might be that people would take their anecdotal evidence of divinity as support for whatever unprovable mutually exclusive doctrine they were inculcated with as children.[xi] The tragicomic end to many debates with the religious of North America is the evocation, when reason has failed them, of “God works in mysterious ways.” This seems to be a rather crucial juncture to arrive at, because if it is in fact the case that God works in mysterious ways then the faithful should be forced to openly confess that they do not in fact know that any of their religious claims are true. If magic is real then all bets are off. We are as unable to distinguish between competing religious images of God when positing her existence as when we more parsimoniously view existence without the need to assume divine intervention. As William James once said,\n\n“the logical reason of man operates in this field of divinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds arguments for our conviction, for indeed it HAS to find them. It amplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and plausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure it.”[xii]\n\nReligion likely serves an entirely different purpose than one of explanation. We should try to be generous and always try to address the content of the claims of those who oppose us in argument and likewise submit our own propositions to at least an internal cross-examination for its possible psychological drives.[xiii] Regardless, the upshot of the logical indistinguishability of unverifiable, mutually exclusive claims to absolute truth given the existence of God on one hand or its absence on the other behooves us to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[xiv] And as individuals we are without any non-arbitrary foundation for treating other persons differently than we would have others treat us.\n\nWherever we are, whatever we think we believe we should be able to recognize that the certainty of our beliefs is more psychological than real. It is absurd to think that what we think could have the certainty that a mathematical proof has. The pragmatic tradition argues that humans as a species think in order to believe, i.e. belief properly understood is thought at rest, such that it can provide rules for action. I am trying to cultivate a practice acceptance of uncertainty, of tentativity when a proposition seems more likely than not.\n\nOur only effective response to this uncertainty is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[xv] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of non-internal predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xvi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously.

Not just the big question. The little question. Why are we gathered here today?  What is the relationship between these questions? What is the difference in perspective between the big and little “why are we here?”?  Is it unfair to say that it is only a matter of perspective?  I ask that you take this moment to take three deep breaths with me. It occurred to me to jokingly ask how many breaths I could get out of this audience, or how many collective breaths there are until the bloc of 20 minutes is up and whether or not that might provide a larger benefit to the audience than the rest of this paper.[i] And I think this is a good paper. We need to take more care in our understanding of broader conceptions, especially those with pretensions because of the increasing complexity involved as scale increases, and I will try to tie together why we are here as philosophers with why we are here at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us start small. You presumably chose to be here, to listen/read. Hopefully you had some good reasons. If the conceptual objects being sustained in your thought stream now are intensely personal, striking to the core of how your identity is defined, good for you. Philosophy is as philosophy does. What is a philosopher other than one who philosophizes. It certainly is not the paycheck or the pedigree that makes the philosopher lest we omit greats like Socrates, arguably the father of western philosophy. But really this is just a rationalization, confabulatory even. We do not really know why we are here. We do not really know what compels us to write and listen. No you say, I had good reason to be here. It was this, that, and the other thing. But who or what determined the value you fundamentally place on the smallest units of your decision making process? It could not be the conscious you. Whence has your rubric come? From what source do you derive your orienting values?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surely we will want to be as accurate as possible. We will want our assessments to be meaningfully true, to represent fairly what we might call objective reality. I am going to assume that I am not a figment in your imagination and that you are not a figment in mine, and that therefore a reality exists independently of your or my awareness of it. Given then that we seem to be little tiny bits of reality, it should be rather uncontroversial to say that reality or existence is vastly greater than any one of us at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we want to be confident that something is true then it is easier if what we are trying to test or verify is first, verifiable even in principle, and furthermore more limited in scope than not. It can be safely said that the more limited the scope of the question the more likely we are to agree on the veracity of any particular answer. Without resorting to doing violence to the common meanings of the words we use, the vast majority of us would be compelled to agree to and even attest to the truth of a rather large number  statements, many of which would be rather trivially so, like this piece of paper is white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think  these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire lives, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? How does this repercuss, so to speak? There is a clear difference between certitude and certainty. Let us try not to confuse the former for the latter. Let us practice withholding final judgments and be humble and tentative in our metaphysical speculations. How does such a stance take shape? If most of what we think we know, is exactly that, what we think we know, not what we actually know; if much of what we “know” is wrong or unfounded, what do we know or what can we know? We know for example that we cannot trust revelation[ii], and that belief in supernatural agency is more explicable than supernatural agency itself. Just like the childhood belief in the boogeyman is more explicable than the existence of an actual boogeyman. All supernatural belief is speculative. As such, it is entirely inappropriate to take seriously any of the various claims to a monopoly on Truth (with a capital “T”). We certainly know that eliminationist rhetoric, promoting the conclusion of a debate by physically eliminating the opposition is wrong. In fact, it seems we need the exact opposite. Exactly because we are so limited, so prone to error, and so talented in “knowing” we are the ones that are right, that caring about the actual truth requires us to place the utmost value on evidence, dissent and disagreement to give us a chance to be less wrong collectively. As Richard Feynman said, “the first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as a species, we have jury-rigged some workaround systems in seeking arenas of accountability, the most successful of which appear to be science, democracy, courts, and markets. Unfortunately it is increasingly clear that as markets became distorted by the oligarchical power of increasingly consolidated multinational corporations an era of high corruption was soon to follow with consequences in the operation and perception of each of the four accountability arenas. I have written and spoken elsewhere on the known uncertainties and certainties addressing our species collectively and our duty as American and global citizens to become more politically aware and engaged as our political class gets away with torture and mass murder[iii], the gap between scientific and public opinion on key issues like global warming continue to grow[iv], and the American Dream circles the toilet drain.[v] So we will assume temporarily that our serious problems as a nation and species will go away on their own, perhaps abetted by the exponential acceleration of technological development and ignore the call to actively stand with our brothers and sisters in Egypt standing up to authoritarian power there as Americans  probably should here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will forego then what might be considered the most pragmatic approach (let’s do something right now). Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tremendous opportunity exists. Science has become the clear leader in building the broadest possible consensus of rational thought, mapping and explaining the world around us with the fewest possible assumptions. But it is  humble and abashed. Good scientists abound and constantly fret about overstating their case or making specific policy prescriptions for fear of tarnishing their reputations as scientists and being no longer seen as the pursuers of truth no matter which way it leads, as they so strive to be. We need to take science and scientists seriously. And apparently they need our help. We need to forcefully make the normative claims that many opine science is incapable of making, as if, the truth, i.e. what has been consistently and reliably shown to be the case, were not relevant in deciding what we should do and how we should behave as individuals and as a species. I have said elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“William James argues that rather than believe nothing he would rather be duped repeatedly in the hope each time that he’s been blessed with knowledge. I would argue that each time William James or anyone else really believes an incorrect belief, in doing so they make it less likely that they will be able to recognize a different hypothesis or theory that better aligns itself with the evidence. To make a computer analogy, religious belief is outdated software.a The inconsistency with the external world is combated by mechanisms specifically evolved to banish conflicting facts or alternative views because in some cases they are considered “of the devil”. In fact, contrary to the James’s implication that beliefs often cycle, the opposite tendency is so strong that there is a saying in science that it progresses one death at a time. As the rate of technological development increases, wisdom becomes more salient and the ability to change our society to fit the world more important. To reiterate then one of the primary benefits of Clifford at James’ expense, it is not solely the content of belief that matters, but the rigidity with which it is held.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, but where does uncertainty get us? Uncertainty gets us all sorts of goodies, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?”[vi]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to find where we as individuals fit in an ecological understanding of philosophy and where philosophy fits in the ecology of knowledge, society and human survival. Way back when, Nietzsche foretold the death of God, when society would no longer be able to ground itself in absolutes. The time is long overdue to take non-tautological/non-mathematical absolutes for what they are, remnants of God. With advances in our understanding like evolution and fractal geometry we can see quite clearly how complexity (even infinite complexity) can arise from iterations of relatively simple algorithms and that this makes resorting to a divine creator in our descriptive understanding of the universe intellectually superfluous at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The religious amongst us most of all seem to be entirely ignorant of the history of religious belief and how it has changed through time. First the gods were everywhere and as humans explored, gods retreated to the mountaintops, and then to the sky, and finally by the time we realized that our planet is a lonely speck in a vast cosmos God retreated into an abstract transcendent realm. Regardless of the fact that God has always been an “of the gaps” variety, this is quite fine by me, I do not see much of a difference between pantheism and atheism in how the universe they describe would look, but there is possibly a related but non-dependent psychological difference between being alone and being alone together. It might be easier as a practical matter to implement and sustain a healthy reverence for life and existence from a pantheist or Spinozan perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I see less and less import from a pragmatic point of view in quibbling about the existence of God. God is a sentiment. A sentiment like any other lens or ideology progressively less amenable to change through reason as we age.[vii] I am entirely comfortable siding with some of the great mystics and spiritual teachers against the tribal fundamentalists of all religions. We can reach people we otherwise would not be able to if we can talk to them in a language of a God that we can show them they do not understand; speaking of God in the Einsteinian sense and indistinguishable from reality or the entirety of existence.[viii] God is the sum total of everything, and the sum total of everything is by definition a mystery to any limited creature. [ix]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since at least James’ The Varieties of Religious Experience it must have been quite clear to many that religious dogma makes rather many more claims than the religious feeling upon which it is founded. That people have experiences that make them feel like the existence of God is undeniably true seems undeniably true. That any of these experiences should be interpreted to support the biblical notion that a woman who is not a virgin on her wedding night should be stoned to death is patently ridiculous.[x] In fact it should be as transparently ridiculous that any of these experiences should be taken to support the truth of any one particular religion, however psychologically understandable it might be that people would take their anecdotal evidence of divinity as support for whatever unprovable mutually exclusive doctrine they were inculcated with as children.[xi] The tragicomic end to many debates with the religious of North America is the evocation, when reason has failed them, of “God works in mysterious ways.” This seems to be a rather crucial juncture to arrive at, because if it is in fact the case that God works in mysterious ways then the faithful should be forced to openly confess that they do not in fact know that any of their religious claims are true. If magic is real then all bets are off. We are as unable to distinguish between competing religious images of God when positing her existence as when we more parsimoniously view existence without the need to assume divine intervention. As William James once said,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“the logical reason of man operates in this field of divinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds arguments for our conviction, for indeed it HAS to find them. It amplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and plausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure it.”[xii]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Religion likely serves an entirely different purpose than one of explanation. We should try to be generous and always try to address the content of the claims of those who oppose us in argument and likewise submit our own propositions to at least an internal cross-examination for its possible psychological drives.[xiii] Regardless, the upshot of the logical indistinguishability of unverifiable, mutually exclusive claims to absolute truth given the existence of God on one hand or its absence on the other behooves us to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[xiv] And as individuals we are without any non-arbitrary foundation for treating other persons differently than we would have others treat us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wherever we are, whatever we think we believe we should be able to recognize that the certainty of our beliefs is more psychological than real. It is absurd to think that what we think could have the certainty that a mathematical proof has. The pragmatic tradition argues that humans as a species think in order to believe, i.e. belief properly understood is thought at rest, such that it can provide rules for action. I am trying to cultivate a practice acceptance of uncertainty, of tentativity when a proposition seems more likely than not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our only effective response to this uncertainty is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[xv] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of non-internal predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xvi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xvii]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. This paper is attempting to do something recursive rather than lineal. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xviii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know.

Not just the big question. The little question. Why are we gathered here today?  What is the relationship between these questions? What is the difference in perspective between the big and little “why are we here?”?  Is it unfair to say that it is only a matter of perspective?  I ask that you take this moment to take three deep breaths with me. It occurred to me to jokingly ask how many breaths I could get out of this audience, or how many collective breaths there are until the bloc of 20 minutes is up and whether or not that might provide a larger benefit to the audience than the rest of this paper.[i] And I think this is a good paper. We need to take more care in our understanding of broader conceptions, especially those with pretensions because of the increasing complexity involved as scale increases, and I will try to tie together why we are here as philosophers with why we are here at all.\n\nLet us start small. You presumably chose to be here, to listen/read. Hopefully you had some good reasons. If the conceptual objects being sustained in your thought stream now are intensely personal, striking to the core of how your identity is defined, good for you. Philosophy is as philosophy does. What is a philosopher other than one who philosophizes. It certainly is not the paycheck or the pedigree that makes the philosopher lest we omit greats like Socrates, arguably the father of western philosophy. But really this is just a rationalization, confabulatory even. We do not really know why we are here. We do not really know what compels us to write and listen. No you say, I had good reason to be here. It was this, that, and the other thing. But who or what determined the value you fundamentally place on the smallest units of your decision making process? It could not be the conscious you. Whence has your rubric come? From what source do you derive your orienting values?\n\nSurely we will want to be as accurate as possible. We will want our assessments to be meaningfully true, to represent fairly what we might call objective reality. I am going to assume that I am not a figment in your imagination and that you are not a figment in mine, and that therefore a reality exists independently of your or my awareness of it. Given then that we seem to be little tiny bits of reality, it should be rather uncontroversial to say that reality or existence is vastly greater than any one of us at the moment.\n\nIf we want to be confident that something is true then it is easier if what we are trying to test or verify is first, verifiable even in principle, and furthermore more limited in scope than not. It can be safely said that the more limited the scope of the question the more likely we are to agree on the veracity of any particular answer. Without resorting to doing violence to the common meanings of the words we use, the vast majority of us would be compelled to agree to and even attest to the truth of a rather large number  statements, many of which would be rather trivially so, like this piece of paper is white.\n\nThe class of true statements that most of us find interesting are those that are not trivially true. They often say something about larger chunks of reality or how we would like to think  these relate to each other, or how they might be organized into some structural whole. The only problem is that the more a statement or argument purports to say, i.e. the larger the scope of the claim, the more likely that our cognitive and perceptual tools will have a relatively diminished ability to verify such a claim. So the biggest and most important assertions that we make consciously, and even more importantly subconsciously; the stories, doctrines and patterns that we are most likely to use to guide our behavior because they are the context into which we place our entire lives, these concepts are precisely those most likely to be untrue.\n\nWhat does this mean? How does this repercuss, so to speak? There is a clear difference between certitude and certainty. Let us try not to confuse the former for the latter. Let us practice withholding final judgments and be humble and tentative in our metaphysical speculations. How does such a stance take shape? If most of what we think we know, is exactly that, what we think we know, not what we actually know; if much of what we “know” is wrong or unfounded, what do we know or what can we know? We know for example that we cannot trust revelation[ii], and that belief in supernatural agency is more explicable than supernatural agency itself. Just like the childhood belief in the boogeyman is more explicable than the existence of an actual boogeyman. All supernatural belief is speculative. As such, it is entirely inappropriate to take seriously any of the various claims to a monopoly on Truth (with a capital “T”). We certainly know that eliminationist rhetoric, promoting the conclusion of a debate by physically eliminating the opposition is wrong. In fact, it seems we need the exact opposite. Exactly because we are so limited, so prone to error, and so talented in “knowing” we are the ones that are right, that caring about the actual truth requires us to place the utmost value on evidence, dissent and disagreement to give us a chance to be less wrong collectively. As Richard Feynman said, “the first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.\"\n\nFortunately, as a species, we have jury-rigged some workaround systems in seeking arenas of accountability, the most successful of which appear to be science, democracy, courts, and markets. Unfortunately it is increasingly clear that as markets became distorted by the oligarchical power of increasingly consolidated multinational corporations an era of high corruption was soon to follow with consequences in the operation and perception of each of the four accountability arenas. I have written and spoken elsewhere on the known uncertainties and certainties addressing our species collectively and our duty as American and global citizens to become more politically aware and engaged as our political class gets away with torture and mass murder[iii], the gap between scientific and public opinion on key issues like global warming continue to grow[iv], and the American Dream circles the toilet drain.[v] So we will assume temporarily that our serious problems as a nation and species will go away on their own, perhaps abetted by the exponential acceleration of technological development and ignore the call to actively stand with our brothers and sisters in Egypt standing up to authoritarian power there as Americans  probably should here.\n\nWe will forego then what might be considered the most pragmatic approach (let’s do something right now). Zooming out, we are confronted by a situation in which philosophy in general has become increasingly viewed as largely irrelevant to both the concerns of everyday persons and the needs of the scientific community. If we care about truth, we care about the state of the world and the relationship the human species has to it. We must not forego combating untruths and misinformation wherever we find them, least of all here, but we should not spend all of our time in our ivory tower bogged down in abstract and esoteric debates that ignore the very real suffering of real persons. As members of an interconnected species we are all in this together.\n\nA tremendous opportunity exists. Science has become the clear leader in building the broadest possible consensus of rational thought, mapping and explaining the world around us with the fewest possible assumptions. But it is  humble and abashed. Good scientists abound and constantly fret about overstating their case or making specific policy prescriptions for fear of tarnishing their reputations as scientists and being no longer seen as the pursuers of truth no matter which way it leads, as they so strive to be. We need to take science and scientists seriously. And apparently they need our help. We need to forcefully make the normative claims that many opine science is incapable of making, as if, the truth, i.e. what has been consistently and reliably shown to be the case, were not relevant in deciding what we should do and how we should behave as individuals and as a species. I have said elsewhere:\n\n“William James argues that rather than believe nothing he would rather be duped repeatedly in the hope each time that he’s been blessed with knowledge. I would argue that each time William James or anyone else really believes an incorrect belief, in doing so they make it less likely that they will be able to recognize a different hypothesis or theory that better aligns itself with the evidence. To make a computer analogy, religious belief is outdated software.a The inconsistency with the external world is combated by mechanisms specifically evolved to banish conflicting facts or alternative views because in some cases they are considered “of the devil”. In fact, contrary to the James’s implication that beliefs often cycle, the opposite tendency is so strong that there is a saying in science that it progresses one death at a time. As the rate of technological development increases, wisdom becomes more salient and the ability to change our society to fit the world more important. To reiterate then one of the primary benefits of Clifford at James’ expense, it is not solely the content of belief that matters, but the rigidity with which it is held.\n\nDogma cannot provide a non-arbitrary foundation for ethics, but where does uncertainty get us? Uncertainty gets us all sorts of goodies, especially if we consider the question of values in general to be an empirical question of the proper way to treat each other according to the growing scientific knowledge about emotional health and wellbeing as  Sam Harris would argue. But even without immediately running to the data, accepted and acceptable uncertainty is breathing room. It is the space we need for an open and ongoing discussion about ethics, survival, and the human species. It is freedom from the shackles of our long history of various claims of absolute truth, spiritual and otherwise. Uncertainty is tentativity. If the best understanding of the world by our greatest minds is in constant revision shouldn’t our own understanding of the world be in constant revision? How often do you update your software?”[vi]\n\nWe need to find where we as individuals fit in an ecological understanding of philosophy and where philosophy fits in the ecology of knowledge, society and human survival. Way back when, Nietzsche foretold the death of God, when society would no longer be able to ground itself in absolutes. The time is long overdue to take non-tautological/non-mathematical absolutes for what they are, remnants of God. With advances in our understanding like evolution and fractal geometry we can see quite clearly how complexity (even infinite complexity) can arise from iterations of relatively simple algorithms and that this makes resorting to a divine creator in our descriptive understanding of the universe intellectually superfluous at best.\n\nThe religious amongst us most of all seem to be entirely ignorant of the history of religious belief and how it has changed through time. First the gods were everywhere and as humans explored, gods retreated to the mountaintops, and then to the sky, and finally by the time we realized that our planet is a lonely speck in a vast cosmos God retreated into an abstract transcendent realm. Regardless of the fact that God has always been an “of the gaps” variety, this is quite fine by me, I do not see much of a difference between pantheism and atheism in how the universe they describe would look, but there is possibly a related but non-dependent psychological difference between being alone and being alone together. It might be easier as a practical matter to implement and sustain a healthy reverence for life and existence from a pantheist or Spinozan perspective.\n\nHowever, I see less and less import from a pragmatic point of view in quibbling about the existence of God. God is a sentiment. A sentiment like any other lens or ideology progressively less amenable to change through reason as we age.[vii] I am entirely comfortable siding with some of the great mystics and spiritual teachers against the tribal fundamentalists of all religions. We can reach people we otherwise would not be able to if we can talk to them in a language of a God that we can show them they do not understand; speaking of God in the Einsteinian sense and indistinguishable from reality or the entirety of existence.[viii] God is the sum total of everything, and the sum total of everything is by definition a mystery to any limited creature. [ix]\n\nSince at least James’ The Varieties of Religious Experience it must have been quite clear to many that religious dogma makes rather many more claims than the religious feeling upon which it is founded. That people have experiences that make them feel like the existence of God is undeniably true seems undeniably true. That any of these experiences should be interpreted to support the biblical notion that a woman who is not a virgin on her wedding night should be stoned to death is patently ridiculous.[x] In fact it should be as transparently ridiculous that any of these experiences should be taken to support the truth of any one particular religion, however psychologically understandable it might be that people would take their anecdotal evidence of divinity as support for whatever unprovable mutually exclusive doctrine they were inculcated with as children.[xi] The tragicomic end to many debates with the religious of North America is the evocation, when reason has failed them, of “God works in mysterious ways.” This seems to be a rather crucial juncture to arrive at, because if it is in fact the case that God works in mysterious ways then the faithful should be forced to openly confess that they do not in fact know that any of their religious claims are true. If magic is real then all bets are off. We are as unable to distinguish between competing religious images of God when positing her existence as when we more parsimoniously view existence without the need to assume divine intervention. As William James once said,\n\n“the logical reason of man operates in this field of divinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds arguments for our conviction, for indeed it HAS to find them. It amplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and plausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure it.”[xii]\n\nReligion likely serves an entirely different purpose than one of explanation. We should try to be generous and always try to address the content of the claims of those who oppose us in argument and likewise submit our own propositions to at least an internal cross-examination for its possible psychological drives.[xiii] Regardless, the upshot of the logical indistinguishability of unverifiable, mutually exclusive claims to absolute truth given the existence of God on one hand or its absence on the other behooves us to treat each other how someone like Carl Sagan would; with recognition that indeed now more than ever we are all in this together as a species, with all our eggs in one basket. We are one bad asteroid strike from having all the intelligent life we have found in the universe wiped out.[xiv] And as individuals we are without any non-arbitrary foundation for treating other persons differently than we would have others treat us.\n\nWherever we are, whatever we think we believe we should be able to recognize that the certainty of our beliefs is more psychological than real. It is absurd to think that what we think could have the certainty that a mathematical proof has. The pragmatic tradition argues that humans as a species think in order to believe, i.e. belief properly understood is thought at rest, such that it can provide rules for action. I am trying to cultivate a practice acceptance of uncertainty, of tentativity when a proposition seems more likely than not.\n\nOur only effective response to this uncertainty is collective, super-organismic really. A single neuron is structurally incapable of picking out the salient features of the environment to protect the life of a complex multi-cellular organism. It can only do so through organization with other neurons such that there is a constant bi-directional feedback loop in the system.[xv] Similarly the human species having stepped outside of non-internal predatory constraints like a colony of bacteria in a flask will grow until the resources to sustain human life are consumed and the species will collapse unless we become collectively organized to behave intelligently in the environment that the species finds itself (to say nothing of the cannibalization of the many by the few). No lone prophet or thinker will be able to show us the way. And if our collective process begins to have a homological and not merely analogical relationship with multi-cellular organisms there are certain things that we might predict about its development. If consciousness is itself a certain special kind of sensory apparatus of complex processing for which it acts as a global workspace for various parts of the mind to communicate with each other,[xvi] the most noble goal that philosophy can aspire to is to work toward becoming this global workspace for our species. Philosophy can and should be the place through which the species comes to know itself. To take this project seriously is to take the sensory apparatus of the species seriously. The only sensory apparatus of the species worth its salt is scientific because it is the only reliable and transmissible form of relatively accurate information about the universe including us. It is not difficult to speculate on the various organs of a nascent superorganism. Humans have organized into progressively higher order units. There does not seem to be any good reason to assume that to be a trend that does not continue.[xvii]\n\nHowever, depending on how one defines purpose, function may or may not be a helpful aspect in how one contemplates one’s existence, but it can describe how we got here and where we might be going. This paper is attempting to do something recursive rather than lineal. No story has a happy ending because all your achievements are going to dissolve and you are going to die; no matter how many millions you have in the bank it becomes meaningless.[xviii] We are not here for the story we tell ourselves about who we are. Our life has no externally dictated meaning. We breathe meaning into our lives on a moment by moment basis. Likewise just like a fractal we can see self-similarity of this pattern on a larger scale, zooming out arbitrarily far, certainly past and including the level of any superorganism. Life itself has no externally dictated meaning. Meaning is breathed into life on a moment by moment basis by the fields of awareness that inhabit it. But at the end of the day, we don’t really know. Our individual conceptions of the universal will always fail us. Like infants we may be able to hold a certain field of view, but incapable of containing the context that makes sense of everything.\n\nThe biggest favor you can pay me is to show me I am wrong, but of course I cannot take your word for it.

I know it isn&amp;#39;t a big problem, because he shows he&amp;#39;s caring in physical ways by making sure I&amp;#39;m taken care of, cuddling, etc. I stay the night at his place often and whenever I ask, he always says he wants me to stay. We have a great time together, and I always let him know that if he feels like we shouldn&amp;#39;t hang out as much, then that&amp;#39;s fine. He always seems to want to have me over and to spend time. Sex is great, I just feel like maybe our sexual relationship as developed further than our emotional one. So there&amp;#39;s that.

Throughout my life the emotion of being depressed has come and gone, thoughts have entered my mind and what not. Nothing has ever happened nor have I ever done anything to put myself or anyone else in danger. I see all forms of hurting yourself as being selfish, especially when one ends their lives. I&amp;#39;m simply just stressed and drowning in depression at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little back story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My life hasn&amp;#39;t been all dandy and what not but I struggled through most of my childhood and teenage years as a loner. Usually clinging to a few friends while being too worried about my looks, personality and such to try and meet new people or ever dwell in relationships. I&amp;#39;ve only been in 2 relationships and I&amp;#39;m currently 22. I&amp;#39;ve never been the one to open up to others easily and I&amp;#39;m usually quiet, shy and nervous around new people. Well bring it to about August of last year I was in my final weeks of my job, I was quitting because I was heading off to school and living in the city. While the month of August was early on I took notice of a new girl working there, to me she looked amazing..basically fell for her there, played stupid for a few days to find out her name. Eventually she stopped showing up at work and what not, turns out she was fired but I happened to find her on Facebook. Again, normally a shy and weary person I was afraid to add a stranger. It took a couple of days, maybe a week or two before I worked up the courage. Basically sat down, said fuck it I&amp;#39;ll add her, the worse thing possible is she doesn&amp;#39;t add me or simply goes on about how she doesn&amp;#39;t know me and what not. I added her and like a little child quivered with fear of whether she would accept me or not. In about a day or so she did, all was cool, I never bothered to talk to her on Facebook (again, I&amp;#39;m terrible at talking to people). Time passes and I get an ear infection, one night it wakes me up with the point of I can no longer stay asleep. I sign on Facebook and Aim, see if any of my close friends are on and suddenly a window pops up of her saying hey and what not. This was what set forward a chain of events that I honestly will never forget and I can&amp;#39;t even honestly remember what I did two days ago. The first month was amazing, I never felt so accepted by someone and I never imagined how much I would ever open up to someone. I would talk to her for hours on end, sit in parked cars in parking lots and chat, get to know her and hangout as much as possible. Eventually I was living in the City with her back home but she would come and visit and I would go and visit her. This started to upset my parents who were paying for my dorm in the City and I was spending city money on train tickets and such to be with this girl. Blah Blah Blah..Fast forward maybe a month or so, around October? We had our first big fight, which would only amount to more and more. I always tried to keep my cool but everything pointed to something was wrong. She would grow angry with me over the littlest of things, she would threaten to leave because she didn&amp;#39;t want to be hurt by the fact that my best friend is a female that I had, at one point, had a crushed on when I was in 9th grade (2004). I would often have to chase after her, grab her and hold her close. Promise her the world and more that nothing of the matter would ever come between us. I was wrong though, it only got worse. For Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years I literally blew off my friends and family to be with hers. It was never enough, each holiday was a fight over how I didn&amp;#39;t talk with her family members or get to know certain people I may never meet again (due to their age/ health and what not) but as I have said both here and to her I am a shy person, I don&amp;#39;t communicate well with many people. Days would pass and she would eventually apologize, I would try to keep my cool as best I could. The real problems started earlier this year and I made some very poor decisions. Starting more towards Valentines Day we got into a bumpy road, why I don&amp;#39;t recall but I know earlier this year we had arguments over such stupid things like I wanted to wear a pair of jeans on a normal day but she had a fit because they had holes in them. This is where I started to stand up for myself, question what was wrong with the pair of jeans I had worn so many times before. Things only got worse, she would often ask people input on our relationship by putting it into the perspective of another couples relationship. I resorted to venting to my friends about everything. For Christmas I bought her a ring that she wanted, she knew I had bought it for her. She would ask for it continuously, I wanted it to be a special Christmas gift. I vented to my friends about how annoying it was to have her basically pester me because she wanted the ring so bad. Maybe I was wrong, but in a way it felt she just wanted the ring..Eventually she snooped through my phone (something she ALWAYS did, and I never did*) read the texts and again threatened to leave and what not. I was always stuck apologizing, saying sorry and mending the wounds. Another time I took her out to eat, my treat, and she read a text I hadn&amp;#39;t seen from a friend (stupidly childish joke) and walked out. I had to pay for a meal that was basically wasted and have a ruined night. For Valentines Day I spent around 100$ (may seem like a lot, might not, either way it was out of 300$ tax return) and I bought her everything she could want, her favorite candy..anything and everything. I then brought her out for a 70$ meal at Red Lobster and ended the night off with a promise ring (ugh). Eventually though, things went sour, I just couldn&amp;#39;t handle the stress between school and her. She would get into arguments with me basically every night. It was just so overwhelming for me to handle, I just couldn&amp;#39;t take it. One night I had enough, I was about to leave her she freaked out. We went inside my house where things only got worse. I accidentally mentioned that what she was doing was making me feel the same way I did with my ex girlfriend. Poor choice on my part, she flipped a shit, ripped up all of my pictures of us, threw her rings at me (this was maybe the second or third time she had done this, forgot to mention that too..oops). Was a rough patch, apparently she was texting my one friend who she considered a best friend. (she barely knew this kid) and told him everyone of her dirty secrets in a sense and flirted with him (who knows what else she had done with whoever). At this point I was filled with hate, so betrayed and left alone. I told my mother what had happened (fucking bad idea) and eventually she figured out my now ex-girlfriend had stuff of mine. Mainly a video game my mother bought me years ago. I tried to avoid the hassle and get the game back myself, my ex-girlfriend wouldn&amp;#39;t budge. My mother got involved and a fiasco happened (big surprise). Fast forward a bit, I sent an apology message to my ex-girlfriend for my behavior, noting it wasn&amp;#39;t trying to get her back or anything just mend the wounds and maybe at the least be there for her as a friend (i truly cared about her). She replied, we talked and what not then she fell for me and I fell in the trap again. We tried to mend the wounds when my parents found out and I guess they were in a way trying to stop me from being with someone they knew was trouble (I told them about what she and her friend texted me) and basically forbid me from seeing her. I still did. It was only much harder this time around. For the following few months we would try to meet up and hangout for a little here and there, spend time with each other and talk. It all just felt weird and nothing was adding up. She was texting old guy friends (most of which she had a quite sexually explicit relationship with in the past) and at the same time being flirty with me and saying she only wanted me/ love me. I still fell for all of this, deeper into it than I had before. Every other time I was fine. Suddenly things turned nasty in these past few weeks, eventually leading to the last fight. I am considered the worst thing to happen to her, biggest douche and everything. I&amp;#39;ll admit it, I was a dick..but only because I started to speak up and defend myself during fights. Somehow defending myself and speaking up made me a dick. So my only options in the whole relationship was agree and apologize or argue and be a dick. The last thing was probably the most fucked up because she swore up and down she never wanted to lose me, how much I changed her and made her happier. Suddenly it was the final line of &amp;quot;did you really think we would work out, that we would end up together? grow up and act your age&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something about those words and everything I put into the relationship just hit me like a bombshell. I never put so much time into someone, I never was this into someone. I never was so attached to anyone before. It was all something new to me and I guess old to her. She would drone on and on about this ex and that ex, how I was the best thing and now this. It sunk me back into something I fought to get out of long before I met her and she managed to put me right back there. Hell, at one point when we first started dating one of the guys she had been sexual with at one point texted her asking if they could do it one last time..knowing I was dating her. Sure I could go by the words of someone, I promise I won&amp;#39;t or only you and no one else. These things still stay in the back of your mind, embedded there..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL,DR&lt;/strong&gt; Was in a relationship for short of 9 months. Ignored friends and family who warned me to get out of it early on, dealt with a lot of shit. Got put down in the very end.

While commie Bulgaria was sponging on Russia and all the import/export was with Moscow, Romania decided to pay their external debts. They were really really poor in the late 80s, but when Communism fell they had no debt. Bulgaria sold most of it&amp;#39;s gold to USSR for cash, because it was clear that this regime was not working here. The people weren&amp;#39;t working hard so the economy was damn slow.

People just want to get a degree, get a job, get a SO, a home, a car and just live. Not to explore, travel and develop.

The bureaucracy is killing me, because everything you want to file must be done personally. And I can&amp;#39;t, because I am at work.

They are criminals, so they really don't care about laws and regulations. The average citizen actually dislikes UK because of the foggy and cold weather, the different culture and the huge ammount of Indians and Pakistanis. I myself am not a racist, but most of Bulgarians are. We have about 7% gypsies which historically come from India.\n[Just an example: Link to www.dailymail.co.uk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cenmk9z?context=5)|Bulgarian criminals are mostly working in Belgium and Netherlands, because the prostitution business is going quite well and the money is good.\n[Protip, paki is not acceptable.

It was started in 1977 so some parts were made slowly in the time. Yes, I've driven on it. The speedlimit is 140 km/h, but the cameras start working when you pass by with at least 165.\n[If I drove this highway to the Black Sea and spent a vacation there, what would I see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cenms4z?context=5)|If you drove you would get to Bourgas, which is 40 minutes away from Sunny Beach, the biggest sea destination in Bulgaria. Here we are relying on the so-called \"alcohol tourism\". It's a phenomenon in which fake alcohol is sold at ridiculous price, so a lot of tourists just come here to get unimaginably drunk. And since it's pushing the economics, the government is shutting their eyes for the unlicensed alcohol and drugs. And the no-contract policy which a lot of employers have, so they can spend some money from taxes. \n[Wow fake alcohol, I'll pass, but unlicensed drugs, I'm in. Seriously I'd like to see Sunny Beach one day. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cenptbx?context=5)|Both the alcohol and drugs and whores are cheap, because they are crap. And Sunny Beach is nothing to be seen, you have to experience it. It's something like Malia (Greece) or Tijuana (Mexico), but even cheaper.\n[Why is Bulgaria poorer than say it's neighbour Romania? Was it like that even before 1991?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cenmcih?context=5)|Well Bulgaria and USSR had a really close connection because of the language and common history. While commie Bulgaria was sponging on Russia and all the import/export was with Moscow, Romania decided to pay their external debts. They were really really poor in the late 80s, but when Communism fell they had no debt. Bulgaria sold most of it's gold to USSR for cash, because it was clear that this regime was not working here. The people weren't working hard so the economy was damn slow. And here we have the main difference.\n[Are you proud of being Bulgarian? Are most Bulgarians generally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cenn7r5?context=5)|Oh yeah, we have quite impressive history. The heroic acts of many Bulgarians while we were under Ottoman slavery are an example of patriotism and manliness today, 140 years later.\n |Most Bulgarians are also proud, but they tend to believe all kinds of myths who can make Bulgaria look a bit more positive. There's this legend that Bulgarians are the second-smartest people in the world. After the jews. And thats just it, noone asks who said it or based on what is that statement. Bulgarians just feel like it.\n |John Atanasoff, the inventor of the first electronic digital computer is of Bulgarian ancestry. This doesn't stop people to say that Bulgarian invented the computer. Also we managed to keep our name (Bulgaria) from 681 till now, which is quite impressive. \n[Too bad its regarded as \"Ottoman presence\" in newer textbooks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/ceogdaj?context=5)|[Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cennr50) \n[Don't you think it's bad that people would rather move away from your country to richer EU nations and abandon Bulgaria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1v0xbn/iama_journalist_born_and_raised_in_bulgaria_the/cenmqlx?context=5)|Well the biggest problem in Bulgaria are the Bulgarians. Most of them don't actually care about anything, even their future. We had 30,000+ people demonstrating and marching in Sofia, our capital, but at the other cities there were no protests or whatsoever at all. People just want to get a degree, get a job, get a SO, a home, a car and just live. Not to explore, travel and develop. Just to exist and not die of hunger.\n |Of course I learned this the hard way. At first I was all \"I want to stay, because the smart people should stay and push the country forward\". Now I think it's all bullshit.

As a consequence of me saying this, the other guy also suddenly saw the 9 and so when they asked him he also said '9, not written down'. We were both made to write it down, then asked to re-record the last 10 seconds. This prompted a great deal of poor acting from me at least. Another time I was all set to declare TRANNIES for 8, but in the dying seconds spotted INTERNALS for 9, therefore denying me a classic moment.\n[How different is playing on the actual compare to playing along at home for example, did you find it more stressful to come up with solutions or was there little difference between them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jtvk/iama_former_octochamp_on_british_tv_quiz_show/c7dqskn?context=5)|I didn't really find there was any difference between playing in the studio and playing at home. However, on my first show, I was up against a very very good player (highly ranked online, had already won 5) and so not expecting to beat him went in without really any nerves affecting me.

The only American shows that spring to mind for me are Wheel of Fortune, Deal or No Deal and Pyramid, which I would argue comparatively require less skill, although I'm sure there are quiz shows more akin to the British ones I've listed as well.\n[Jeopardy!  is the gold standard.

I first applied aged 14 and was rejected, but got on when I reapplied aged 17. From memory, I think you fill in a relatively standard form, then I think most get invited to audition. You play a few rounds of the letters, numbers and conundrums, and before gave a little introduction of yourself which might count in terms of seeing how personable you are (I don't know if this is true). They let you know within a few weeks if you are going on or not, then you usually tend to record a few months after this, although this can vary. I can't really say how difficult it was as there's not set score which if you get, you get on, but I'd think you would need to be reasonably good in the audition to have a chance.\n[Were you 17 when you were on the show?

I usually went one from the top and any other five, only breaking this to try and take the points solely on my own (i.e. went for three large as it was more difficult in the hope I'd get it and the other contestant wouldn't) if it was a close game, OR in a poor attempt to joke/flirt with Rachel I once asked for two small and any four large of her choice- the joke being there are only four large to choose!

On the other hand, would likely have been a lot of hassle selling/sending the dictionaries, but the extra £2k probs compensates for it.\n[Why for the numbers round can contestants say for example \"two large and 4 small\" but on the letters round they can't say \"4 vowels and 5 consonants\"? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jtvk/iama_former_octochamp_on_british_tv_quiz_show/c7dyata?context=5)|I think it's probably because they set the target number after the selection, so picking the numbers one by one isn't as useful. It's certainly more useful to pick the letters one by one as I've explained elsewhere- mainly because by using common stems of letters, it helps inform your selection better for later letters.\n[I'm about to go for an audition in the new year, any tips?

Explain this real life 8+ club.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14jtvk/iama_former_octochamp_on_british_tv_quiz_show/c7dq3o0?context=5)|There's a website/community online (and offline, they also have events) where you can play Countdown, and though it's open to everyone you will find the people who play the most are usually Octochamps. The standard is as crazy good as on the IT Crowd- there are variants with more letters, variants with shorter time, variants with 'hidden' letters, variants with random numbers (i.e. double-digit which aren't 25, 50 or 75). As I never really got that into the community I can't really pass on much knowledge of how the games worked as I only played the version you see on TV. People get ridiculously good as they play thousands of games, to the point where people average over 100 for over the 15-round format and solve even very difficult conundrums in under 2 seconds without even trying.\n[There is a Countdown Teapot.

I enjoyed reading the stories the last time and would like to know what are some unexplained things that have happened to you.  Here are some of mine:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.) When I was 8 years old, my friend Patrick and I were in the woods near our houses. We were pretty deep into the woods when all of a sudden we hear Patrick&amp;#39;s mom calling us. There was no mistaking her voice, since she had a very unique Austrian accent. We keep hearing her calling out to us and we finally make it to his house and asked his mom what she needed. She said she never called us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 1 -&lt;/strong&gt; Creepy voices in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2.) I remember chasing my own doppelganger around my yard when I was 9. When I finally thought I had cornered it between a fence and a wall, it had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 2 -&lt;/strong&gt; Chased my own doppelganger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.) When I was 7 or 8, I remember going to the boys bathroom at school and some writing appeared on the mirror (like when you write on the mirror after you take a hot shower). The same thing happened a few days later on the mirror in the bathroom at my house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 3 -&lt;/strong&gt; Creepy writing on mirrors appeared out of nowhere and happened in multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4.) This one is tricky, but I swear it happened. When I was between the ages of 7-9, I remember waking up one morning and seeing crawfish all over the streets and on people&amp;#39;s lawns and cars. It had rained pretty viciously the night before and my friend and I were running around picking up the crawfish and playing with them. They were all making their way to the streets and floating down into the sewers. My friend vaguely remembers this and my parents don&amp;#39;t. I can&amp;#39;t find record of this ever happening (newspaper, radio, etc.), however there are records of animals raining down from the sky in other parts of the world.  Someone had suggested it may have been a tornado.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 4 -&lt;/strong&gt; It rained crawfish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5.) When I went to Ireland in the spring of 2000 for a school trip, we were staying at a hotel in this little town by a beach. Everyone on the trip ended up going to this club to party it up and my girlfriend and I, along with another couple, went to a nearby casino/arcade to play some games. We played for a bit and called it an early night and made our way back to the hotel. Everyone else was still out partying. The next day we all wake up for breakfast, pack our bags, and get back on the bus. Everyone is there except for one guy, Gilbert. The chaperons start freaking out thinking Gilbert may have wandered into the ocean while he was drunk and drowned. He wasn&amp;#39;t in his room or in anyone else&amp;#39;s room, so the hotel management starts going floor by floor and room by room looking for Gilbert. The girls on the bus start crying, expecting the worst, the adults are all freaking out. After about an hour, they find Gilbert. He&amp;#39;s exactly one floor up from the room he was supposed to be in (615 instead of 515, for example). Nobody knows how he got into his room as that room was not rented out and that floor was empty except for one other guest. Everybody, including the staff, was baffled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 5 -&lt;/strong&gt; Kid disappears on school trip and mysteriously appears one floor above where he was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6.) When I was 17, my girlfriend and her parents went on a trip to Hawaii. She asked me to go by her house every few days and watch her cats, give them food, etc. One day, I&amp;#39;m asleep and hear a cat meowing in my dreams. I them dream about a cat being stuck in a pond. I immediately wake up and rush over to my girlfriend&amp;#39;s house only to find her cat drowning in a shallow pool of water in an above ground swimming pool. I rescue the cat and all is well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 6 -&lt;/strong&gt; Dreamt about a cat drowning and ended up rescuing a real cat from drowning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7.) Before my first day of starting at a new private school in a new town, I had a nightmare involving this horrific abstract human face. Everywhere I would look in my dream, this face would appear, and it was quite an unsettling visage. I woke up ready for school, a little bit shaken up by this dream, but thought nothing of it. On Friday, at the end of the my first week at this new school, we were required to go to mass. Upon walking into the church, the face that had haunted my dreams several nights before was the same face that was on the post-modern/abstract Crucifix hanging above the alter. I had never set up in that church prior to that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 7 -&lt;/strong&gt; Haunted by a horrific visage in my dreams only to realize it was the face on a crucifix an an actual sculpture a few days latter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8.)  A few months ago, I was at home, chilling in my living room, and I saw an intense flash of light fill up the living room for a brief moment, followed by a boom that sounded like a cross between thunder and an explosion.  It shook the house and set off car alarms in the neighborhood.  Other neighbors heard it too and we stepped outside to see what had caused it.  There wasn&amp;#39;t a sign of anything having caused this - not a cloud in the sky, no contrails overhead (or jet noises before the boom), no indication of an explosion.  It was just so random.  The thing that bothers me is not so much the boom, but the flash of light.  It was in the middle of the day, so it had to have been pretty bright to lighten up my living room more that it already was.  Additionally, I have some thick-ass wooden blinds that will keep most light out, so for light to have gotten past them, what ever the flash was, it was bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR 8 -&lt;/strong&gt; Unexplained flash and boom in the middle of a clear day that rocked the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, I&amp;#39;ve seen some weird things that I can&amp;#39;t explain. I don&amp;#39;t believe in the paranormal nor am I superstitious, but I am at a loss with these anomalous situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"There was submission like this that was posted several months ago.

I don't believe in the paranormal nor am I superstitious, but I am at a loss with these anomalous situations.","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"feao1","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"theghostofabe","num_comments":609,"score":113,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":true,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/feao1/what_are_some_unexplainable_events_or_phenomenon/","name":"t3_feao1","created":1296709021,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/feao1/what_are_some_unexplainable_events_or_phenomenon/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"What are some unexplainable events or phenomenon that you've observed in real life?","created_utc":1296709021,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":113},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_feao1","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"more","data":{"count":9,"parent_id":"t1_c1fawxl","children":["c1fbohg","c1fcne9","c1fdpxw","c1fejt7","c1fm955","c1ghe6q"],"id":"c1fbohg","name":"t1_c1fbohg"}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"c1fawxl","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"PhatBoiRL","parent_id":"t3_feao1","score":62,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I think you'll appreciate the [nosleep subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/).","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;ll appreciate the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/\"&gt;nosleep subreddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","subreddit":"AskReddit","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_c1fawxl","created":1296727637,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":1296727637,"ups":62,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},"threadNum":0,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":8,"label":"negative"},{"question":"Have you ever been to Mexico?","thread":{"domain":"self.AskReddit","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AskReddit","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also pay for WinRar. \nEdit: No, I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"I also pay for WinRar. \nEdit: No, I don't.","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"yowgv","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Fruktjuice","num_comments":8,"score":2,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/yowgv/i_just_paid_10x_the_usual_price_for_a_taxi_in/","name":"t3_yowgv","created":1345726710,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yowgv/i_just_paid_10x_the_usual_price_for_a_taxi_in/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"I just paid 10x the usual price for a Taxi in Mexico City.

He cares about the band a bit more than anything else, happy to see them all succeed. He&amp;#39;s easily the most mature member, and at times acts as a de-facto &amp;#39;leader&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; The band&amp;#39;s gear, their awesome secret base, their tour truck, their jet, and their submarine. Also a fair bit of cash&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; He was a singer in a failing shitty band in his first life, and over the course of his career he ended up losing his faith in god and turning to drugs, alcohol, etc. He died at age 25 in a barfight. Several years later, however, he awoke in his coffin, having no clue what just happened. When he managed to dig himself out, he found that his body was in great condition, and had an intricate &lt;a href=\"http://epicswalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/aidXkLMiG.jpg\"&gt;tattoo of a celtic cross&lt;/a&gt; on his chest. Little did he know that some divine power had risen him as a mortal representation of their power, turning his very body into a holy artifact of great power. After that he ended up running into and befriending a few aspiring superhuman musicians and starting a successful band with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_Aura\"&gt;Divine Aura&lt;/a&gt;: His body is literally a holy artifact, and it exudes an aura of holy energy. He cannot direct this energy as attacks, but it naturally harms anything weak to holy energy and makes a sweet windstorm when he wants it to. It also acts as an energy barrier against some attacks and generally increased his physical abilities to somewhat superhuman levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Energy_Infusion\"&gt;Holy Energy infusion&lt;/a&gt;: Anything he touches becomes temporarily infused with holy power, acting as a fairly high-level holy artifact. It will also operate at peak non-enhanced efficiency for that kind of item. This effect persists for a few minutes after he lets go of the item.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Holy_Voice\"&gt;Holy Voice&lt;/a&gt;: Straight-up holy vocal cords. His voice naturally sounds great and somewhat soothing, and can speed up healing. He can also make shockwaves be yelling, which count as holy shockwaves. Lastly, he can project his voice to anyone he&amp;#39;s met before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stats:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;shouting&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflex Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Willpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical  Willpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;this guy already died once, he&amp;#39;s a bit more chill about it now&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;well, if you where to literally cut the tatoo off of his chest that would probably stop his powers until it heals back.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;also, his voice can boost anyone nearby to a 6. if they&amp;#39;re higher or equal to 6 already it does nothing&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melee Skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melee Reach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;normal human reach plus a spear that doubles as his mic stand&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranged Skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy/Range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;a bit above average, also any projectiles he fires will be holy-fied by his powers&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Usage -

Also, every member has their own private room in the base.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; Her family didn&amp;#39;t really want to accept that their &amp;#39;son&amp;#39; was a daughter, but she also didn&amp;#39;t really care what they wanted to accept since they had raised her to do what she thought was right. Also, the fact that she started tossing fire and shit at around the same time as when she came out didn&amp;#39;t help her parents deal with it much either. Still, they at least accepted her choice to try to join a band, which is nice. She also legally changed her last name after the whole fiasco with her family. Also, before anyone asks, she&amp;#39;s pre-op and still deciding if she wants to do any operation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Manipulation\"&gt;Elemental Manipulation&lt;/a&gt;: She&amp;#39;s able to control the four stereotypical elements of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air.

She can&amp;#39;t control elements inside another living thing, so no breath removal or bloodbending shit. Fire is the only one she can generate from nothing.

He especially loves teasing Kali because she&amp;#39;s easy as fuck to piss off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; same as the rest of the band&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; He was a student studying chemical engineering who ended up being accepted to work as an intern at a place doing research work for the military. While there he ended up accidentally getting hit up with the super secret project they where working on, blowing the place up in the process and giving him superpowers. Also, his old band kicked him out a bit before that because they where assholes, so he joined the band a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Transmutation\"&gt;Elemental Transmutation&lt;/a&gt;: He has the power to turn pure (or mostly pure) elements into other pure (or mostly pure) elements through touch. He can only turn them into other elements in the same group on the periodic table (transition metals to transition metals, rare earth metals to rare earth metals, alkali metals to alkali metals, alkaline earth metals to alkaline earth metals, boron family to boron family, noble gases to noble gases, etc). The item also turns back about ten minutes after he lets go, and he can only change a combined amount of about twenty cubic meters at a time. Also, by pure or mostly pure, I mean that if, for example, a block of iron has some rust on it, he can still change the rest of the block, but if the stuff is totally combined, like if it&amp;#39;s some NaCl, he can&amp;#39;t do shit to it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Mimicry\"&gt;Elemental Mimicry&lt;/a&gt;: He can transform his body into almost any element which is solid at room temperature. His body will still be able to move by shenanigans. Being in this form also boosts his physical abilities somewhat&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stats:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflex Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;he was an aspiring chemist&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Willpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical  Willpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5/7&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;his sense of pain is dulled when in elemental form&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3/8&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;depends entirely on what element he picks.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;he has the weaknesses of whatever element he picks, if he picks something that conducts electricity well then electricity it fucks him up, something that conducts heat well then heat fucks him up, if it&amp;#39;s something flamable he becomes flamable, etc. He cannot control non-pure substances, keeping pure substances of him will limit him greatly&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melee Skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melee Reach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;human plus whatever weapon he&amp;#39;s using&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranged Skill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accuracy/Range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;average at best&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Usage -

He is one of the most enthusiastic about the band and about being in it, despite being one of the least famous members of it. He is also a total otaku, loving anime and the like, but he&amp;#39;s remarkably quiet about that stuff unless directly asked about it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Same as the rest of the band, also a bunch of computers and other bits of tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; He was a total nerd who always dreamed of being a hero, and once the band first started he became a huge fan. Eventually he managed to work out where their original secret base was and go to meet them, also accidentally helping them defeat a villain in the process. As thanks for helping, they let him join the band as a little trial run, and eventually allowed him to be a full-fledged member. During this time he also worked on their new base, their private jet, and their submarine, called Abelstar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Enhanced_Intelligence\"&gt;Enhanced Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;: For unknown reasons his mind works in overtime, making him learn very quickly and work things out fast.

In demon Guardian form her whole body becomes covered in that black energy. No one&amp;#39;s seen her face, as it is always obscured by the shadows of her hood magically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality:&lt;/strong&gt; She&amp;#39;s quiet but determined, she rarely speaks to the rest of the band and when she does it&amp;#39;s normally only to say something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Same as the rest of the band&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; Her family has, for generations, had a powerful demon bound to their service. She is the newest &amp;#39;charge&amp;#39; for him, and it&amp;#39;s his job to use his magic to defend her from his cage down in hell. However, the downside of having a demon bound to your family is that people have a tendency to do things like call you all monsters and kill a lot of you off in a giant angry mob. Hint: that happened to her. Luckily for her, Lazarus kind of adopted her shortly after that fiasco, enrolling her in a school and later letting her join the band. He&amp;#39;s not an asshole so he doesn&amp;#39;t mind her powers, but being near him sometimes gives her a headache.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Materialized_Guardian\"&gt;Materialized Guardian&lt;/a&gt;: She can summon an ethereal representation of her guardian demon, who claims to be Zagan, though there&amp;#39;s no real evidence for that. His representation appears as a black smoky figure with glowing red lights where its eyes should be. He cannot be directly hit by physical attacks, but those that hit her will hurt him. Holy powers are harmful to him to the point where he cannot willingly touch a holy object or enter a holy place uninvited (being invited still makes it painful, but doable), and will force him to disperse if he spends too long near them. He must semi-solidify in order to interact with the physical world, leaving him open to being blocked and thrown around, though these attacks won&amp;#39;t cause him physical harm. He can also form into place overlapping with Lacey, due to his ability to simply phase through matter, and doing so provides him with some degree of defense from holy power and Lacey a degree of protection from physical harm, though it still causes physical pain. His touch can cause physical pain and burns due to his unholy power, his touch and breath both carry powerful unholy energies, and he has jagged claws and teeth. Lastly, he knows a fair amount about the goings-on in the underworld, both the literal and figurative one, and is often a good source of information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Demonic_Magic\"&gt;Demonic Magic&lt;/a&gt;: She can also call on him to use demonic magics. His powers are somewhat limited, but useful. Firstly, he can fire hellfire from either her or from his representation if it is summoned. Secondly, he can flood a weapon or item or Lacey herself with unholy power, causing its wounds to take longer to heal and be more effective on anything weak to demonic energies. Thirdly, he can physically knit wounds back together which is painful but helps them heal somewhat faster. Lastly, he can make portals that lead to other places on earth. Any given portal will have a small hallway in between the entrance and exit portals that is 1/5000 the real-world distance traveled. He can only make portals to places he or Lacey knows. Portals take about a second to open and can&amp;#39;t open anywhere touching a living being, so no just portalling under someone and dropping them from the moon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stats:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3/4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Zagan moves at 4. also, he flies.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflex Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Willpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;learning to not let a demon loose is kind of important&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical  Willpower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;3/5&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;5 when overlapped with Zagan&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nonnumerical&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Holy powers can seriously fuck up Zagan, and if someone where to go on a full-on journey to the underworld I suppose they could find and free Zagan but that would be damn difficult and (while he would stop giving her power) he wouldn&amp;#39;t kill her since she wasn&amp;#39;t the one who imprisoned him and she wasn&amp;#39;t a cruel master. Generally, this would depower her but not kill her.

She normally wears sunglasses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality:&lt;/strong&gt; Rather happy, but not in an excitable way, simply content with life and her friends. She can act rather motherly towards people she likes. She dislikes being treated like she&amp;#39;s incapable just because of her disability (being blind).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; same as the rest of the team&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory:&lt;/strong&gt; Half African and half American, she grew up in her mother&amp;#39;s homecountry of America. She was born blind as a bat, and so her mother tended to dote on her, although she quickly learned to be fairly self-sufficient even with her disability. It helped that she began to have very good hearing. It wasn&amp;#39;t long, however, until she realized that some of the things she was hearing weren&amp;#39;t noise- they where something no one else on the world was hearing. She began to use her newfound psychic shit and her skills with a violin to work as a street performer for some cash for her family, where Lazarus found her and invited her to join the band.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Telepathy\"&gt;Telepathy&lt;/a&gt;: She can hear the thoughts of other people nearby at will. She can also read through their memories and thoughts if given a minute or two to find what she&amp;#39;s looking for. She can also speak to people telepathically and transmit thoughts to them as long as they let her. If someone has specialized training to do so they can block her out, making the thoughts she sees muddled and unclear. Trying to hear the thoughts of someone who is completely insane causes her to have a serious migraine, to the point where it is difficult to stand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Empathy\"&gt;Empathy&lt;/a&gt;: She can do a much weaker version of her telepathy on large groups at once, allowing her to check the general emotional state of large groups of people at once. This and her telepathy together allow her to locate people within a certain range even though she is blind,but she cannot locate anything with no psychic signature (robots, dead things, etc) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Telekinesis\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;: She has somewhat low-level telekinesis, allowing her to move objects at a distance.

These are the guys.\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Lazarus Zach\n\n**Place in the band:** Vocalist\n\n**Age:** 30 (40 counting time he's been dead)\n\n**Physical Description:** [Kinda like this](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140407195845/yakuza-mob-roleplay/images/5/59/Kotomine.Kirei.full.1027646.jpg)\n\n**Personality:** He's a laid-back cool headed kind of guy now, dieing horribly makes you a bit more pensive after all. He cares about the band a bit more than anything else, happy to see them all succeed. He's easily the most mature member, and at times acts as a de-facto 'leader'.\n\n**Personal Assets:** The band's gear, their awesome secret base, their tour truck, their jet, and their submarine. Also a fair bit of cash\n\n**Backstory:** He was a singer in a failing shitty band in his first life, and over the course of his career he ended up losing his faith in god and turning to drugs, alcohol, etc. He died at age 25 in a barfight. Several years later, however, he awoke in his coffin, having no clue what just happened. When he managed to dig himself out, he found that his body was in great condition, and had an intricate [tattoo of a celtic cross](http://epicswalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/aidXkLMiG.jpg) on his chest. Little did he know that some divine power had risen him as a mortal representation of their power, turning his very body into a holy artifact of great power. After that he ended up running into and befriending a few aspiring superhuman musicians and starting a successful band with them.\n\n**Powers:** \n\n[Divine Aura](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_Aura): His body is literally a holy artifact, and it exudes an aura of holy energy. He cannot direct this energy as attacks, but it naturally harms anything weak to holy energy and makes a sweet windstorm when he wants it to. It also acts as an energy barrier against some attacks and generally increased his physical abilities to somewhat superhuman levels.\n\n[Holy Energy infusion](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Energy_Infusion): Anything he touches becomes temporarily infused with holy power, acting as a fairly high-level holy artifact. It will also operate at peak non-enhanced efficiency for that kind of item. This effect persists for a few minutes after he lets go of the item.\n\n[Holy Voice](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Holy_Voice): Straight-up holy vocal cords. His voice naturally sounds great and somewhat soothing, and can speed up healing. He can also make shockwaves be yelling, which count as holy shockwaves. Lastly, he can project his voice to anyone he's met before.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n |  | |\n:---|:---|:---\n***Attribute*** | ***Stat Level*** | ***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details*** | \n**Primary Strength**| 4  |  |\n**Secondary Strength**| 6 | shouting|\n**Movement Speed**|  4  ||\n**Reflex Speed**|  5  ||\n**Attack Speed**| 4 || \n**Intelligence**| 2 ||\n**Wisdom** |  5  ||\n**Mental Willpower** | 4 | |\n**Physical  Willpower** | 6  | this guy already died once, he's a bit more chill about it now |\n**Durability**|  5  ||\n**Weakness**| Nonnumerical | well, if you where to literally cut the tatoo off of his chest that would probably stop his powers until it heals back. |\n**Recovery**|  6  | also, his voice can boost anyone nearby to a 6. if they're higher or equal to 6 already it does nothing|\n**Stamina** |  4  ||\n**Melee Skill** |  4  ||\n**Melee Reach**| Nonnumerical | normal human reach plus a spear that doubles as his mic stand|\n**Ranged Skill** |  4  ||\n**Accuracy/Range**| Nonnumerical| a bit above average, also any projectiles he fires will be holy-fied by his powers |\n**Power Usage - Variety** | 4 ||\n**Power Usage - Area** | 5 ||\n**Power Usage - Reserves** | Nonnumerical  | yelling too loudly for too long can fuck up his throat for a while |\n**Weaponry**|Nonnumerical | a spear that doubles as his mic stand and a couple pistols his carries around. |\n**Danger**| 4 | much higher on anyone weak to holy power, also they'll be hurt by just being anywhere near him |\n**Special/Other**| Nonnumerical||\n**Total**| 76 | |\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Kali Buster\n\n**Place in the band:** Lead Guitarist\n\n**Age:** 23\n\n**Physical Description:** [like this](http://s1.tsuki-board.net/pics/figure/big/32941.jpg)\n\n**Personality:** a rowdy and loud girl who basically hates to stand still and can be a bit of a brat. She cares about the rest of the band but doesn't like showing it because she thinks that makes her look weak.\n\n**Personal Assets:** Same as the rest of the team. Also, every member has their own private room in the base.\n\n**Backstory:** Her family didn't really want to accept that their 'son' was a daughter, but she also didn't really care what they wanted to accept since they had raised her to do what she thought was right. Also, the fact that she started tossing fire and shit at around the same time as when she came out didn't help her parents deal with it much either. Still, they at least accepted her choice to try to join a band, which is nice. She also legally changed her last name after the whole fiasco with her family. Also, before anyone asks, she's pre-op and still deciding if she wants to do any operation.\n\n**Powers:**\n\n[Elemental Manipulation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Manipulation): She's able to control the four stereotypical elements of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. She can move them telekinetically with fair strength. She can only control up to two different ones at a time, to start controlling another she has to stop controlling one. She can't control elements inside another living thing, so no breath removal or bloodbending shit. Fire is the only one she can generate from nothing. Also, she can control their states to a degree, as in turning water to ice or vapor and turning earth to magma.\n\n**Stats:**  \n\n |  | |\n:---|:---|:---\n***Attribute*** | ***Stat Level*** | ***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details*** | \n**Primary Strength**| 2  |  |\n**Secondary Strength**| 6 ||\n**Movement Speed**| 2/5 | she can fly when controlling wind or fire, and can make platforms of ice or earth to fly on |\n**Reflex Speed**|  3  ||\n**Attack Speed**| 5 || \n**Intelligence**| 2 ||\n**Wisdom** |  3  ||\n**Mental Willpower** |  3 | |\n**Physical  Willpower** | 4 | |\n**Durability**|  3/6  | can make ice or earth armor of dur.6 |\n**Weakness**| Nonnumerical | she is easily caught by surprise, she loses her temper easily, and disorienting her with something like a flashbang screws up her ability to control elements temporarily |\n**Recovery**|  3  ||\n**Stamina** |  4  ||\n**Melee Skill** |  3 ||\n**Melee Reach**| Nonnumerical | human reach plus whatever she's holding |\n**Ranged Skill** |  7  ||\n**Accuracy/Range**| Nonnumerical| great with her elements, but doesn't know how to use a gun or anything well |\n**Power Usage - Variety** | 6 ||\n**Power Usage - Area** | 5 ||\n**Power Usage - Reserves** | Nonnumerical  ||\n**Weaponry**|Nonnumerical | just a pair of brass knuckles and a can of mace |\n**Danger**| 5 ||\n**Special/Other**| Nonnumerical||\n**Total**| 66/72 | |\n\n---\n\n**Name:** George Rufus\n\n**Place in the band:** Bass Guitarist\n\n**Age:** 23\n\n**Physical Description:** [a bit like this](http://shinmaru.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nobuhirodrinking.jpg)\n\n**Personality:** He is usually laid-back, if a bit full of himself, but he also loves teasing anyone who'll fall for it. He especially loves teasing Kali because she's easy as fuck to piss off.\n\n**Personal Assets:** same as the rest of the band\n\n**Backstory:** He was a student studying chemical engineering who ended up being accepted to work as an intern at a place doing research work for the military. While there he ended up accidentally getting hit up with the super secret project they where working on, blowing the place up in the process and giving him superpowers. Also, his old band kicked him out a bit before that because they where assholes, so he joined the band a bit later.\n\n**Powers:**\n\n[Elemental Transmutation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Transmutation): He has the power to turn pure (or mostly pure) elements into other pure (or mostly pure) elements through touch. He can only turn them into other elements in the same group on the periodic table (transition metals to transition metals, rare earth metals to rare earth metals, alkali metals to alkali metals, alkaline earth metals to alkaline earth metals, boron family to boron family, noble gases to noble gases, etc). The item also turns back about ten minutes after he lets go, and he can only change a combined amount of about twenty cubic meters at a time. Also, by pure or mostly pure, I mean that if, for example, a block of iron has some rust on it, he can still change the rest of the block, but if the stuff is totally combined, like if it's some NaCl, he can't do shit to it. \n\n[Elemental Mimicry](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Elemental_Mimicry): He can transform his body into almost any element which is solid at room temperature. His body will still be able to move by shenanigans. Being in this form also boosts his physical abilities somewhat\n\n**Stats:**\n\n |  | |\n:---|:---|:---\n***Attribute*** | ***Stat Level*** | ***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details*** | \n**Primary Strength**| 4 |  |\n**Secondary Strength**| 0 ||\n**Movement Speed**|  3  ||\n**Reflex Speed**|  4  ||\n**Attack Speed**| 4 || \n**Intelligence**| 5 | he was an aspiring chemist |\n**Wisdom** |  3  ||\n**Mental Willpower** | 4 | |\n**Physical  Willpower** | 5/7 | his sense of pain is dulled when in elemental form |\n**Durability**|  3/8  | depends entirely on what element he picks. |\n**Weakness**| Nonnumerical | he has the weaknesses of whatever element he picks, if he picks something that conducts electricity well then electricity it fucks him up, something that conducts heat well then heat fucks him up, if it's something flamable he becomes flamable, etc. He cannot control non-pure substances, keeping pure substances of him will limit him greatly |\n**Recovery**|  4  ||\n**Stamina** |  4  ||\n**Melee Skill** |  4  ||\n**Melee Reach**| Nonnumerical | human plus whatever weapon he's using |\n**Ranged Skill** |  3  ||\n**Accuracy/Range**| Nonnumerical| average at best |\n**Power Usage - Variety** | 6 ||\n**Power Usage - Area** | 4 ||\n**Power Usage - Reserves** | Nonnumerical  | he can't really eat or drink in his elemental form, he needs to turn back for that |\n**Weaponry**|Nonnumerical | he carries around a bunch of things made from various pure elements, including some daggers, needles, collapsible staves and batons, and just plain chunks of metals |\n**Danger**|  3  ||\n**Special/Other**| Nonnumerical| |\n**Total**| 63/70 | |\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Abel Easter\n\n**Place in the band:** Keyboardist/Turntable player\n\n**Age:** 18\n\n**Physical Description:** [Nerdy and a bit overweight](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29000000/Kohta-highschool-of-the-dead-29086669-494-342.png)\n\n**Personality:** He can act like a bit of a pushover, but he's very excitable when talking about things he likes. He is one of the most enthusiastic about the band and about being in it, despite being one of the least famous members of it. He is also a total otaku, loving anime and the like, but he's remarkably quiet about that stuff unless directly asked about it\n\n**Personal Assets:** Same as the rest of the band, also a bunch of computers and other bits of tech.\n\n**Backstory:** He was a total nerd who always dreamed of being a hero, and once the band first started he became a huge fan. Eventually he managed to work out where their original secret base was and go to meet them, also accidentally helping them defeat a villain in the process. As thanks for helping, they let him join the band as a little trial run, and eventually allowed him to be a full-fledged member. During this time he also worked on their new base, their private jet, and their submarine, called Abelstar.\n\n**Powers:**\n\n[Enhanced Intelligence](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Enhanced_Intelligence): For unknown reasons his mind works in overtime, making him learn very quickly and work things out fast. He can't really reach superhuman levels of intellect, but he's certainly smarter than most people his age.\n\n[Enhanced Inventing](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Enhanced_Inventing): As another part of his intelligence, he's great at inventing strange and awesome things when given the right time and materials. (every invention will be run by mods first, at the moment he just has a couple custom-made but still commercially available things like taser gloves)\n\n[Enhanced Smelling](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Enhanced_Smell): This fatass can smell out tasty unhealthy food from a mile away. Alright, not literally a mile, but a large distance. only applies to things he wants to eat and mostly played for laughs\n\n**Stats:**\n\n |  | |\n:---|:---|:---\n***Attribute*** | ***Stat Level*** | ***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details*** | \n**Primary Strength**| 2  | a low two because he's a fatty nerd |\n**Secondary Strength**| 0 ||\n**Movement Speed**|  2/4  | he has a little hoverboard thing he invented, can't really hold more than two or three people|\n**Reflex Speed**|  2  ||\n**Attack Speed**| 2 || \n**Intelligence**| 8  ||\n**Wisdom** |  8  ||\n**Mental Willpower** | 4 | he got bullied, so he's used to a fairly normal amount of mental abuse |\n**Physical  Willpower** | 2 | |\n**Durability**|  3  | fat acts as protection |\n**Weakness**| Nonnumerical | shoot the fuck. or bitchslap him. |\n**Recovery**|  3  ||\n**Stamina** |  2  | he'll basically be gasping for breath and almost passed out after fighting full strength for this long |\n**Melee Skill** |  1  ||\n**Melee Reach**| Nonnumerical | normal reach |\n**Ranged Skill** |  3/1  | 1 without his glasses |\n**Accuracy/Range**| Nonnumerical| above average with glasses, shit without them |\n**Power Usage - Variety** | 7 ||\n**Power Usage - Area** | 5 | his acute smell is about this range, maybe a bit higher |\n**Power Usage - Reserves** | Nonnumerical  ||\n**Weaponry**|Nonnumerical | he makes a bunch of random strange weapons (any that aren't just re-flavored normal weapons will be mod approved first) |\n**Danger**|  2  ||\n**Special/Other**| Nonnumerical| he ain't really as fat as I'm sayin, I just like teasing my own fictional character |\n**Total**| 55/59 | damn he squishy |\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Lacey Ragnarock\n\n**Place in the band:** Drummer\n\n**Age:** 16\n\n**Physical Description:** [Like this, but those blackened bits can turn back to normal at her will.](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/149/e/0/mage__dancing_demon_by_avodkabottle-d670axr.png). In demon Guardian form her whole body becomes covered in that black energy. No one's seen her face, as it is always obscured by the shadows of her hood magically.\n\n**Personality:** She's quiet but determined, she rarely speaks to the rest of the band and when she does it's normally only to say something important.\n\n**Personal Assets:** Same as the rest of the band\n\n**Backstory:** Her family has, for generations, had a powerful demon bound to their service. She is the newest 'charge' for him, and it's his job to use his magic to defend her from his cage down in hell. However, the downside of having a demon bound to your family is that people have a tendency to do things like call you all monsters and kill a lot of you off in a giant angry mob. Hint: that happened to her. Luckily for her, Lazarus kind of adopted her shortly after that fiasco, enrolling her in a school and later letting her join the band. He's not an asshole so he doesn't mind her powers, but being near him sometimes gives her a headache.\n\n**Powers:**\n\n[Materialized Guardian](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Materialized_Guardian): She can summon an ethereal representation of her guardian demon, who claims to be Zagan, though there's no real evidence for that. His representation appears as a black smoky figure with glowing red lights where its eyes should be. He cannot be directly hit by physical attacks, but those that hit her will hurt him. Holy powers are harmful to him to the point where he cannot willingly touch a holy object or enter a holy place uninvited (being invited still makes it painful, but doable), and will force him to disperse if he spends too long near them. He must semi-solidify in order to interact with the physical world, leaving him open to being blocked and thrown around, though these attacks won't cause him physical harm. He can also form into place overlapping with Lacey, due to his ability to simply phase through matter, and doing so provides him with some degree of defense from holy power and Lacey a degree of protection from physical harm, though it still causes physical pain. His touch can cause physical pain and burns due to his unholy power, his touch and breath both carry powerful unholy energies, and he has jagged claws and teeth. Lastly, he knows a fair amount about the goings-on in the underworld, both the literal and figurative one, and is often a good source of information.\n\n[Demonic Magic](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Demonic_Magic): She can also call on him to use demonic magics. His powers are somewhat limited, but useful. Firstly, he can fire hellfire from either her or from his representation if it is summoned. Secondly, he can flood a weapon or item or Lacey herself with unholy power, causing its wounds to take longer to heal and be more effective on anything weak to demonic energies. Thirdly, he can physically knit wounds back together which is painful but helps them heal somewhat faster. Lastly, he can make portals that lead to other places on earth. Any given portal will have a small hallway in between the entrance and exit portals that is 1/5000 the real-world distance traveled. He can only make portals to places he or Lacey knows. Portals take about a second to open and can't open anywhere touching a living being, so no just portalling under someone and dropping them from the moon.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n |  | |\n:---|:---|:---\n***Attribute*** | ***Stat Level*** | ***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details*** | \n**Primary Strength**| 2  |  |\n**Secondary Strength**| 5 ||\n**Movement Speed**|  3/4  | Zagan moves at 4. also, he flies. |\n**Reflex Speed**|  3  ||\n**Attack Speed**| 3 || \n**Intelligence**| 2 ||\n**Wisdom** |  4  ||\n**Mental Willpower** | 6  | learning to not let a demon loose is kind of important |\n**Physical  Willpower** | 5 | |\n**Durability**|  3/5  | 5 when overlapped with Zagan|\n**Weakness**| Nonnumerical | Holy powers can seriously fuck up Zagan, and if someone where to go on a full-on journey to the underworld I suppose they could find and free Zagan but that would be damn difficult and (while he would stop giving her power) he wouldn't kill her since she wasn't the one who imprisoned him and she wasn't a cruel master.

She normally wears sunglasses](https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1379768224/265355.jpg):\n\n**Personality:** Rather happy, but not in an excitable way, simply content with life and her friends. She can act rather motherly towards people she likes. She dislikes being treated like she's incapable just because of her disability (being blind).\n\n**Personal Assets:** same as the rest of the team\n\n**Backstory:** Half African and half American, she grew up in her mother's homecountry of America. She was born blind as a bat, and so her mother tended to dote on her, although she quickly learned to be fairly self-sufficient even with her disability. It helped that she began to have very good hearing. It wasn't long, however, until she realized that some of the things she was hearing weren't noise- they where something no one else on the world was hearing. She began to use her newfound psychic shit and her skills with a violin to work as a street performer for some cash for her family, where Lazarus found her and invited her to join the band.\n\n**Powers:**\n\n[Telepathy](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Telepathy): She can hear the thoughts of other people nearby at will. She can also read through their memories and thoughts if given a minute or two to find what she's looking for. She can also speak to people telepathically and transmit thoughts to them as long as they let her. If someone has specialized training to do so they can block her out, making the thoughts she sees muddled and unclear. Trying to hear the thoughts of someone who is completely insane causes her to have a serious migraine, to the point where it is difficult to stand. \n\n[Empathy](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Empathy): She can do a much weaker version of her telepathy on large groups at once, allowing her to check the general emotional state of large groups of people at once. This and her telepathy together allow her to locate people within a certain range even though she is blind,but she cannot locate anything with no psychic signature (robots, dead things, etc) \n\n[Telekinesis](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Telekinesis): She has somewhat low-level telekinesis, allowing her to move objects at a distance. She can't do telekinetic cutting, splitting, and the like of OP bullshit, just moving items.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n |  | |\n:---|:---|:---\n***Attribute*** | ***Stat Level*** | ***Rationale, Notes, Non-numeric Details*** | \n**Primary Strength**| 2  |  |\n**Secondary Strength**| 3 | her telekinesis is weak, but can move small objects very quickly |\n**Movement Speed**|  3  ||\n**Reflex Speed**|  4  | lower against beings with no psychic signature|\n**Attack Speed**| 3 || \n**Intelligence**| 3 ||\n**Wisdom** |  6  ||\n**Mental Willpower** | 7 | |\n**Physical  Willpower** | 5 | |\n**Durability**|  5  | she subconsciously weakens incoming blows telekinetically. this means that non-physical attacks treat her as dur.2 |\n**Weakness**| Nonnumerical | insane people, beings with no psychic signature, non-physical things |\n**Recovery**|  4  | |\n**Stamina** |  3  ||\n**Melee Skill** |  3  ||\n**Melee Reach**| Nonnumerical | human |\n**Ranged Skill** |  4  | 1 against things with no psychic signature |\n**Accuracy/Range**| Nonnumerical| she is good at hitting things since she can sense their location psychically |\n**Power Usage - Variety** | 4 ||\n**Power Usage - Area** | 7 | she can sense a large area at once |\n**Power Usage - Reserves** | Nonnumerical  ||\n**Weaponry**|Nonnumerical | she carries some coins, knives, and other small items to use as telekinetic projectiles. |\n**Danger**|  5  | a tiny piece of metal moving very fast can go through most armor fairly easily, though it may not do much damage on the other side on account of being tiny and all.|\n**Special/Other**| Nonnumerical||\n**Total**| 71 | |\n\n\n---\n\nNow, on account of rule 11 they won't all attack someone at once unless the person is strong enough to warrant that, but if someone else attacks them all then the gloves are off. \n\nAlso, I would like it if other people would 'adopt' the other band members than Lazarus for RPing, but on the stipulation that I'll guide them in battle any time they fight as a group so they can actually work as a coherent group.","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":"AoH Character","id":"2srxbt","gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Arcanebolt2","num_comments":21,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":"HeroicCharacter","author_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/2srxbt/band_of_the_bold/","name":"t3_2srxbt","created":1421534415,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/2srxbt/band_of_the_bold/","author_flair_text":"Sam Morpheus Hadrian Hansels Daten band","title":"Band of the Bold","created_utc":1421534415,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2z5u0","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2srxbt","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"more","data":{"count":0,"parent_id":"t1_cntutlv","children":["cntvb5e"],"name":"t1_cntvb5e","id":"cntvb5e"}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"cntutlv","gilded":0,"archived":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Arcanebolt2","parent_id":"t1_cntukd0","score":1,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I still don't see any rule which mindreading breaks.

They found me partly buried in a ditch on the side of Interstate 22 in the rural part of no-man&amp;#39;s-land, Colorado.  The rain was pounding my face, I could barely see out of one eye, blood had stained my vision.  I clung to the hopes of life by mere threads, praying for salvation...and I am not a religious person.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all began five days ago, when my brother Daniel and my friend Allen DuPrie decided to go out on a camping trip.  The weather was perfect and the opportunity seemed right.  Just three young men in the wilderness, fishing, hunting, drinking until we blacked out...you know...the shit that guys in their early 20&amp;#39;s would do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kissed goodbye to modern society, packing the necessary items in Allen&amp;#39;s truck:  a cooler, food for a few days, a tent, sleeping bags, a few lanterns and flashlights, change of clothes, a portable shower, etc.  You know...the normal stuff, no drugs, nothing out of the ordinary.  It took us a few hours, but by 3PM we were well on the road out of Los Vegas, and headed towards the forests of Colorado to make a camp and begin our guys weekend out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel was shining his rifle, a beautiful Winchester .223 hunting rifle with a brand new x20 optical zoom scope.  He had made sure to pack it and purchase all of us a hunting license the moment he heard the word &amp;quot;camping&amp;quot;.  Anything to do with wilderness drove him to break out that gun and shine it until he could practically see his reflection in the wooden stock.  He had also brought our father&amp;#39;s old .35 Remmington and a crossbow he had picked up in his last trip to the outdoorsman store by our house.  (The man practically lived at that store, he had worked there for six years before his wife-to-be told him to get a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; job or she was gone).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours passed as Allen drove, the sun began to dive deeper into the Western sky, teasing us with the idea of Friday night ending just a little bit too soon, but bearing the promise of another glorious day on Saturday morning.  Daniel wanted to press on, driving in the near pitch-blackness of the Colorado wilderness claiming &amp;quot;no one is gonna fuck with three bulky guys and their guns...&amp;quot; but Allen insisted that we stop for the night, which we did.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The motel had a flickering &amp;quot;Vacant&amp;quot; sign on the road, barely shining bright enough to catch the eye of a weary traveler, but nonetheless effective in the forbidding darkness of the Interstate.  The sign promised &amp;quot;Cable TV and Continental Breakfast @ 6:30AM&amp;quot; along with low rates and a &amp;quot;happy stay&amp;quot;.  The innkeeper could have passed for a modern-day Norman Bates as we walked in nearing 10:30 at night.  He looked up through his glasses, glaring at us as we interrupted his book which he had, no doubt, read a few hundred times.  He coughed loudly as we entered, welcoming us with a raspy smokers voice and encouraging us to sign the check-in log.  We chatted a bit with him before paying the man, gaining a key to a room and heading off to bed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morning came quickly and Allen, always a penny pincher, woke us at exactly 6AM to claim the continental breakfast before it was all gone.  Daniel and I looked at each other, dragging ourselves up, dressing and leaving the room for the last time to head to check-out.  The concierge was a pretty little dark-haired girl from Tennessee, (i know because I chatted her up a bit), we exchanged pleasantries and talked about the expected weather.  She asked about where we were headed and when we told her, she looked quite shocked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Haven&amp;#39;t Ya&amp;#39;ll heard?&amp;quot;  We shook our heads...&amp;quot;They say there&amp;#39;s some crazy bastard out there who&amp;#39;s been killing livestock and living up in them woods.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s a safe endeavor if ya&amp;#39;ll know what I mean...&amp;quot;  We exchanged looks of confusion, telling her we would be fine.  She had a certain look in her eyes which I should have taken as a warning, a truthful horrified look, but Daniel wanted to shoot things and Allen wanted his &amp;quot;damned continental breakfast, not a fucking wive&amp;#39;s tale!&amp;quot;  so we pressed on to the dining room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were back on the road before we knew it, sun rising quickly into the clear skies above the Interstate.  We drove for only a matter of minutes before the trees started to appear, engulfing us quickly and deepening our trench.  After an hour or so, Allen turned off onto a dirt side road, looking for a clearing to camp in...after finding none, he switched his 4-wheel-drive on and created his own route into the forest.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little clearing served great for a campsite, and it was about as remote as it could get from the main road.  Nice, private and definitely shooting-safe.  We were absolutely isolated...or so we thought.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We set up quickly, unpacking the tent and setting it up, unrolling our sleeping bags, (Allen bitched at me for leaving bug spray at home as the gnats were irritating him a bit), we hung the cooler in a tree to keep bears away and found a save location to site our guns and crossbow before heading off to begin the hunt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was already close to noon when we trekked off into the wilderness, leaving us only a mere 7 hours of daylight in which to hunt.  We walked quietly through the trees, hoping to find some deer, but none showed.  Daniel, the expert hunter, decided his efforts would be better spent separated from Allen and I, the &amp;quot;chatterers&amp;quot; that were the obvious reason the deer had no interest in us.  He climbed up a tree, using a branch as a seat and used his binoculars to look for deer.  Allan joked with him about being &amp;quot;too army&amp;quot; for his own good, but received a pinecone to the head before we decided to leave my asshole brother alone and instead find a stream to fish.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allen and I headed back towards camp, changing guns for fishing poles and vests for sweat-shirts and hats.  We looked at a map that Allen had used to find this spot, tracing our finger around until we found water about a mile from where we were camped.  We set off and enjoyed an evening of fishing until the stars were well out and we had to walk by torchlight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well as fate would have it, Allen and I snagged a few fish, returning to gloat to Daniel who had...ironically...also snagged some game, a couple of rabbit.  We enjoyed the fresh kills like kings and lay out on lawn chairs until the fire was dying down and the chill of cold set in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We thought we had discovered paradise...but as many have seen before, sometimes paradise is just Hell in disguise.  Nothing really that bad happened the first night...just slightly odd, something Daniel attributed to &amp;quot;bears&amp;quot;.  We had gutted our animals away from camp to keep predators away, but when we woke the next morning, we found the gut-pile had been moved to our camp side, outside of the clearing of trees...it was found when Daniel went to pee the next morning.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second day brought us even better luck, Daniel scored a deer, and Allen and I brought in more than enough fish to feed an army.  We ensured that the gut pile was buried this time before trekking back into our camp to enjoy the food...this is where things start to get weird.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We awoke the next morning to find that the gut pile we had buried were not only in our camp, but some of the intestinal tracks were nailed to the trees...this was definitely not the work of bears.  There were three hearts, two from a fish and one from the deer, in our fire pit.  Blood was spilled in a circle around the outside of the pit.  This should have been enough warning for us, but Daniel decided that this was a game...a ploy by some &amp;quot;hooligan kids&amp;quot; to scare us.  He believed that there must be a camp nearby with some drunk college kids who wanted to fuck with us, and he decided that we should get revenge.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He grabbed the crossbow from the truck, loading it.  &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re gonna scare those fuckers really good with this...&amp;quot; he said aloud, though i&amp;#39;m sure he meant it as a thought...We followed him as he let his &amp;quot;hunting skills&amp;quot; take over.  He found a pair of footprints in the dirt and followed them quickly, analyzing their weight and depth.  He murmured to himself about the &amp;quot;wive&amp;#39;s tale&amp;quot; being more popular than he would have assumed.  A wive&amp;#39;s tale...right...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We followed the trail for what seemed like miles, hours had passed; in fact, the sun was looking towards two or three PM when we finally hit a rocky cliffside.  Daniel swore under his breath and looked straight up...obviously no one had climbed down from there, so someone was screwing with us...this was definitely obvious.  I looked at him, mocking him slightly and told him to take us back to camp so I could make a sandwich.  He angrily agreed and started to lead us back...but stopped dead after 10 minutes...there was no trail to follow, the footprints were gone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He glanced back and admitted that in his hurry, he had forgotten to map it out in his head, but assured us that he knew the road was somewhere to our left and if we walked far enough, we would find it and then be able to walk back to camp....&amp;quot;a few hours...tops!&amp;quot; he said.  We, for some stupid reason, agreed to follow him.  After three more hours the sun was starting to stoop behind the trees, darkness was setting in, a perfect hunting time...the prey was blind and less likely to be offensive.  Traps would become less visible and thus the hunters would be less likely to be seen...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pitch blackness followed the long walk, we reached for flashlights that we had genius-ly left at camp.  I swore at my brother, calling him a moron, arguing quite loudly, telling him that he was completely incompetent before Allen told us to both shut up and realize how dangerous the woods were at night.  Luckily, he had brought his binoculars which had a night-vision lens, thus allowing us to progress, but very slowly.  I turned over the reign of leader to Allen, glaring at Daniel as I again remarked that he was a moron.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our bickering in the pitch blackness echoed through the trees...Allen did a phenomenal job of ignoring us it seemed, that is, until we realized he wasn&amp;#39;t with us...glancing around, Daniel and I searched the nearby trees for him, calling his name loudly...but to no avail.  The darkness is a huge disadvantage, especially in a place so deadly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat on the ground for a moment in the silence, listening for Allen...a snap came from somewhere to the left, I jumped...it was a twig.  &amp;quot;Allen?&amp;quot; I said slowly, but the growling response that met my ears told me that no, this was not Allen.  I prayed for mercy as I slowly rose and directed my hand to my brother&amp;#39;s shoulder, asking him if it was a bear.  He whispered back that it sounded like it...and suggested we back away slowly.  We rose and did...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard Daniel&amp;#39;s footsteps to my right as we slowly crunched through the leaves and plants...that is until i heard him call out loudly in surprise.  &amp;quot;Daniel!?&amp;quot; I shrieked.  He hollered from my right and I walked towards him, bumping right into him by mistake.  He had set foot in a rope-trap that had tightened around his ankle and strung him up in a tree.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The growling grew louder, i swear I could see a pair of eyes in the blackness.  I lifted my brother slightly, hoping that the slack would allow him to fall through the rope, I was wrong.  He told me to find a sharp rock and come back to cut him down and I hastily agreed, telling him to be careful.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stumbling solo adventure in the wild scared the living shit of me, i hated being alone in the dark almost as much as i hated being confronted by a bear.  After at least five minutes of searching, I found the perfect rock and began trekking back to Daniel.  As I approached, he was making a gurgling noise, probably something to do with the blood rushing to his head, and I reached up to the rope to cut it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His body hit the floor with a loud THUD, i reached down to touch his face and reassure him, but found myself touching a very sticky, warm substance...He continued gurgling...what the fuck was this?  There was too much for it to be sap...My fingers traced down his chin to his throat where I felt a wound...a large wound...it extended across his throat completely, blood was pouring out of it and down his face.  He looked up at me and grabbed my hand, causing me to jump...he only said one thing before he died...&amp;quot;Run...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cold chill ran down my spine, no bear had done this, the wound was too perfect, to precise....this was too methodical...I felt a tear run down my cheek as I realized my brother was laying dead at my knees....I pounded on his chest, begging him to come back...but nothing, only a splash of blood on my face.  I stay for what seemed like an eternity before a cold voice came from slightly behind me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said run...I agree with him, prey is not fun unless it&amp;#39;s prey...&amp;quot;  I jerked my head back in the darkness and was able to make out the form of a towering figure...A roar came from behind him...&amp;quot;Well? What are you waiting for?  RUN!&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A shot pierced the air from the gun in this man&amp;#39;s hands.  I rose to my feet, as if obligated and tore off into the night.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My feet pounded against the floor as my heart pounded in my chest.  I was praying for help, some form of assistance, but none came.  He must have been hot on my heels as I zig-zagged through the trees and bushes.  If I were lost, surely this stranger would be lost as well.  I ran for a matter of minutes...or maybe it was an hour...but when my body finally gave out on me, i tripped over a rock and face-planted in the mud.  My heart felt like it was about to explode and my muscles were shaking from the adrenaline...I rolled onto my back and looked up into the sky, the moon shone light all around me, and I slowly turned my head, looking around in the partial light for the man, but no one came.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I breathed a sigh of relief and realized two things, firstly that if I would climb a tree right now, it would significantly increase my chance of surviving him...and his beast....and secondly, that if this water flowing by me was the same river I had been fishing in (we marked our fishing spot), I could find my way back to the car and escape his clutches...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself up, and found a suitable tree with a branch low enough for me to grab as I climbed up, up, up...almost to the top before I allowed myself to relax, leaning my head back and catching my breath...I was safe, for now.  All I had to do now, was stay awake...with my eyes open...not falling asleep....not drifting.....off.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sunlight woke me up, I heard the birds chattering in the skyline, the echo of a woodpecker came from somewhere in the distance.  I glanced at my wrist for the time, but realized I had left my watch and phone in the truck...I forced myself to stretch...such a weird dream to have...but then I caught a glimpse of my hands...soaked in blood, caked in fact.  The sadness filled my heart...followed closely by a stern fear.  I looked around on the ground and saw no one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of surveillance, I decided to risk it...My feet hit the ground with a thud.  I shook leaves off of me and walked towards the stream.  The blood stained the water a slight red as it trickled downstream, it was caked on hard so it took a while to get it off.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I caught a glimpse of my reflection and realized I was more covered in blood that I had initially thought...the wound must have been bad.  I had to get back to the truck and call 9-1-1, someone had to know of last night&amp;#39;s events....but where the fuck was I? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around me, I was surrounded by trees, a call of a bird of sorts broke the silence, the water trickled down a hill..this was not near my fishing spot, but I did remember seeing a few hills slightly North of our spot.  I decided to follow the water, hoping it would lead me to my salvation...and I was right.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within an hour and a half, I came across the familiar spot that Allen and I had been fishing, we had marked the tree nearest to it with an arrow...it was still there, but as I got closer...I noticed that there was something under it...a paper....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dear sirs, though we have not been properly introduced I would like to inform you that you are currently being hunted.  I will not tell you my name, nor my reasons...let&amp;#39;s just say that humanity provides the ultimate game...should you attempt to leave, I have rigged a...treat...for you on the exit route...I hope you&amp;#39;ve enjoyed your stay in these woods, because they will be your FINAL resting place!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bloody handprint with the small side note &amp;quot;SCORE: 1/3&amp;quot; was at the bottom.  This guy was clearly nuts...and as it seemed, the wive&amp;#39;s tales weren&amp;#39;t so false after all...I would have to mock Daniel later....then I remembered...Tears filled my eyes...I began to realize I would never see my brother alive again....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As my tears streamed, I heard a familiar voice...&amp;quot;Rory?&amp;quot;  I looked up to see Allen standing a mere few feet from me, covered in dirt.  I looked up at him, he was bewildered and obviously had wandered all night.  He had bags under his eyes and was looking worse for wear.  I asked him what had happened the previous night and he shrugged...&amp;quot;Donno really, all I remember was holding the crossbow, walking and...bam I woke up hanging in a tree somewhere...&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him of Daniel&amp;#39;s demise and he hugged me...after a while we decided to walk back to the campsite...but carefully as to not trigger any more...traps.  As we walked, the sun beat down on our faces, reddening our skin.  I could smell BO emulating from under my sweatshirt...I removed it and threw it into a bush as we walked...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while, we arrived at the camp site...it was exactly as we had left it...except for one thing:  there was a large pole in the fire pit we had dug...and on that pole was a human skull...the bone was washed clean of any flesh, it was perfectly white...I stared into it, a feeling of knowing filled my heart, that was Daniel...As we approached it, his mouth was agape with the same look of terror that had probably filled his heart the previous night...i noticed that there were a pair of glass eyeballs fitted into the eye-sockets.  They stared at me as though piercing my soul, begging me for an explanation...why had I left him?  Why hadn&amp;#39;t i stopped that crazy son-of-a-bitch?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I removed his skull from the pole and held it in my hands...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ever held a loved one&amp;#39;s head in your hands?  It&amp;#39;s actually a terrifying feeling to know that you possess a part of someone&amp;#39;s lifeless body that was so invigorated and full of life less than 7 hours ago...I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel a pang of remorse again as I held him...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allen looked at me and suggested we keep moving, told me that we should change clothes, eat and keep moving before the psycho caught us.  By my logic, he should have been asleep because he had spent the entirety of the previous night hunting us, killing my brother and then removing his flesh before repositioning it on a pole in the center of our camp, KNOWING we would return eventually and find it.  I suggested that because of this, we needed rest to trek on without dying of exhaustion...and I was in need of a shower.  Allen reluctantly agreed...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I again awoke, this time in the tent, with the sound of birds around me...how could mother nature be such a fickle bitch?  My brother was dead...his head in a bag next to me...yet life carried on as if nothing had happened...I unzipped the tent and walked outside, hoping to find Allen waiting...and waiting he was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey bud, did you catch some sleep?&amp;quot;  I asked...but no reply.  The sun beat down on him, silhouetting him in a perfect manner.  I approached him slowly...&amp;quot;Allen?  You are awake right?&amp;quot;  I didn&amp;#39;t want to scare him, he had fallen asleep with a rifle in his hand and I had no aim to wake him and get shot in the face.  I circled around slowly, allowing for a better angle of his face when I saw it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The side of the tent was coated in fresh blood &amp;quot;SCORE 2/3&amp;quot; was painted...No...I walked to Allen...&amp;quot;Allen?&amp;quot; I reached forward to touch him and found his skull pierced by a single, low caliber round...how had i not heard it?  His throat was slit like my brother&amp;#39;s and blood had poured into his lap.  The hunter obviously took great pride in his methodology of murder, quickly claiming a victim before leaving them to bleed out.  He had been expecting us...but why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knelt by Allen&amp;#39;s body before I heard the crackle of bushes moving...a large beast...nothing I had ever seen before...crawled out, teeth exposed.  It&amp;#39;s flesh was hard like a rhinoceros, it&amp;#39;s teeth were long and sharp...almost tiger-like.  It arched it&amp;#39;s back ready to pounce as it sniffed the air...it was not looking directly at me, but had it&amp;#39;s head cocked to one side...the creature must be blind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now now Tabby...we musn&amp;#39;t spoil our dinner with a light snack...after all, you&amp;#39;ve gotta save some room for dessert...&amp;quot;  A calm, collected voice came from the shadows behind the bush and a towering figure pushed through it.  He was bald, face hidden by an old style gas mask, a face painted onto it in what appeared to be blood.  He was wearing a large grey pleather apron, streaks of blood covered it and splashed onto his camo-pants which were neatly tucked into his combat boots...this man was so stuck in a rut it was no wonder he was after us.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He calmly walked into the camp and the creature purred loudly, retreating into the shadows.  He obviously was smirking with a mischievous and evil face behind that mask.  He approached me and sat in one of our lawn chairs.  &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;m not here to kill you...&amp;quot;  He chuckled dryly.  &amp;quot;No, no...I&amp;#39;m just here to offer you congratulations on succeeding in surviving the longest...and to warn you...&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Warn me?&amp;quot; I asked, my voice now quivering with fear, his mask was seriously freaking me out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes...to warn you...come nightfall, you and I...we will not be as friendly, you will have exactly 2 hours to run as far as you can before I come for you...and if you do not succeed...you will die.&amp;quot;  He reached into his pocket and tossed me a watch.  &amp;quot;Time&amp;#39;s ticking Rory...don&amp;#39;t waste it...&amp;quot;  He rose without another word and walked towards the edge of the camp.  &amp;quot;Oh...and don&amp;#39;t try anything stupid.  The car is rigged to blow and guns will prove less than effective on me...&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a spirit of sheer evil, he vanished into the shadows, the creature following his beck and call.  I shuddered with anxiety...I had to escape... I had to get away.  I did what any rational human being would do...pocketed the watch, grabbed a bottle of water, a flashlight and a hunting knife and turned into the woods, running as fast as my legs would carry me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something told me I was headed the right way, while something else called to me softly, telling me I had no idea where the fuck I was and without Daniel or Allen, I was doomed...even with them I was still in a very bad position.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to run faster, harder, farther....pushing past the pain and ragged breathing.  I dug deep in my spirit, egging myself on and after a rather long twenty minutes, I finally lost my edge and slowed to a jog...then to a walking pace.  The trees taunted me, a mysterious maze created from such peace and serenity.  Like a torture chamber I was trapped inside, a rat in a lab searching for cheese.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped and looked around, hoping for any sign of a landmark..but none met my eyes.  I started walking more, hoping to stumble across something, but only dirt, trees and bushes met my eyes while the call of the wild filled my ears.  I swore under my breath and drew long and hard on the water.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at the time...I was only that much closer to my demise, I had to keep going.  I swear I could hear the creature rustling in the bushes, the deep breathing behind that archaic mask...but when I would turn, nothing but empty trees and deepened shadows would greet me.  My pulse was racing, my fear was gripping me...I knew I had little chance of survival.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Night came quickly, and a dense fog began to settle in around me, further disorienting me...If I had any shred of hope to find the road to safety, it was now completely shattered...crumbled to ashes and flung to the dogs.  I drew my knife, hoping to ward off the creature should it come for me, but only silence filled the air around me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued my path, hoping it was true, and found a soft dirt below my feet begin to harden...I had found what appeared to be a road!  I clicked on my light, finding that I had indeed discovered a dirt road..the same one we came in on!  My heart jumped in my throat, filling me with a sense of protection, guidance and survival I needed to go on.  I noticed a small sign near the turn we had made, an arrow pointed forward claiming there was a ranger station only a mere three miles up the road...it was better to head there than to head back towards the concrete...or was it?  I had seen neither head nor hide of a ranger this entire time...I was now faced with a serious decision, head for the station or head back to the road...something told me to take my chances on the paved surface, that way I would at least have the chance of hitting civilization at some point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around and began my journey back to paved road.  The dirt was slippery under my feet, tough to my shoes and crunched loudly in the empty trench that served as a road.  I kept following it, when a thought popped into my head...that psycho was still out here...wearing his old mask...with that creature and I was in the wide open wilderness....I needed to correct this, so I turned slightly off the road, paralleling it by a mere ten or fifteen feet and continued to walk through the brush and trees, hoping the fog and foliage gave me enough cover.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at the watch, reading it by flashlight, it read: 01:29:22AM.  I decided that at this pace, I would reach the concrete by 3AM...after all, we had driven in pretty slowly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess was right and my luck had turned around, a pair of headlight streamed across the turn off quickly, at around 75MPH, obviously a civilian vehicle...I was probably a good half a mile from it, but still better off than the ranger station.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 2:45:01AM I was only a quarter mile, when my heart jumped with glee.  I was free of that bastard&amp;#39;s clutches, free to call for help and free to escape once and for all!  That was when I heard it...the shot...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A small caliber bullet ripped my ankle hard, forcing me to the ground.  My face hit the dirt and I heard his heavy breathing oh-so-close behind me.  I writhed in pain for a moment when I heard the creature shriek with excitement.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now now, calm down, he&amp;#39;s not yet done!&amp;quot;  Called the voice.  I heard another shot ring out, a ricochet pinged off the hard-packed dirt nearby.  I swore and forced myself up.  If this asshole wanted me dead, i wanted someone to find my body.  I forced myself to limp towards the road as quickly as I could...hobbling on a shattered ankle.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He chuckled lightly from 20 feet behind me, firing yet another shot into the foggy darkness...it clipped my shoulder, ripping flesh from my arm and burning a painful slice into the meat.  I grabbed it and shouted in agony...yelling at the top of my voice, hoping that a passerby would hear my calls and stop, but no one was coming...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The darkness deepened as my flashlight hit the floor, my wounds were bleeding badly and I was in need of a hospital, but I pressed on, kicking up dirt as I hobbled onward...the road was so close...yet so far.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A light rain had begun and my nostrils were filled with the odor of wet concrete, I knew it was no more than 100 feet away, in fact, i could almost make out the shape in the darkness.   90 feet and closing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard another shot ring out, this one absorbed by a nearby tree.  &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll not get away so easily boy!&amp;quot;  The voice was now angry, the creature was anxious and ready to pounce, but he kept the reigns as he reloaded his weapon.  &amp;quot;One more shot my precious, then you can have yours...&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gaining speed as I hobbled closer...how had this man killed two but could not kill me?  Perhaps the fog?  I was wondering almost out loud as I hobbled on.  50 feet and closing.  I could see a trench ahead that was virtually on the road...if I could just get to it.  I ducked back into the trees to help cover me from his rain of gunfire.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel the closeness as I hobbled on.  I was no more than 20 feet at this point when I heard the final round rip through the air...It made contact with the small of my back and pushed me hard to the ground.  I cried out...NO! I would NOT be beaten.  I forced myself up...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He swore and cried out in disbelief....&amp;quot;Get him!&amp;quot;  The creature, faster than I would have anticipated, galloped towards me.  I drew the knife and turned as it jumped.  I felt it&amp;#39;s claws dig into my shoulders and it&amp;#39;s teeth grew close to my face as I force its mouth open with my bare hands.  The knife hung sideways from my fingers and I rolled slightly, allowing myself to grip it at I released the creature&amp;#39;s mouth.  It snapped into the dirt and roared in my ear.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced the knife into it&amp;#39;s flesh and drew it back, blood dripped on to my face.  It shrieked in pain, recoiling and preparing to strike with its paw when I swung again, this time colliding with its throat.  Blood virtually squirted out with a force of a garden hose...It gurgled and wandered around confused for a moment when I heard another shot...this one not intended for me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creature went down hard and stayed down....the gas mask was literally within hand&amp;#39;s reach away and he turned to me intimidatingly.  He dropped his gun, and unhooked his mask with one hand.  Removing it, I immediately cried out in horror.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had no face...literally.  The blank places his eyes belonged were literally holes, nostrils were carved into a bleached bone...his jaw was slacked and mouth was open in a horrible grin.  He laughed with a hoarse laugh...though intimidating, he was way less horrifying with the fucking mask on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His hand closed around my throat, he brought me close to his face and his voice echoed in my very soul:  &amp;quot;This...THIS is the face of death!&amp;quot;  He threw me hard into the darkness, my body flying with a superhuman propulsion...I landed on hard concrete, my skull striking it...I was dazed..badly...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched in horror while fading in and out of consciousness as he walked towards me.  I tried to stand and could not.  He smirked a wicked smile as he approached.  When he stood directly over me, he glared down into my face, a burning fire in the holes where his eyes should be.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You...you have been spared...a brush with death and yet you still fight....you are the ultimate game...and as a hunter, I will allow you to walk...&amp;quot;  With that, his boot came down hard on my temple and I blacked out....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A ranger passing by noticed the body on the side of the road, almost buried in the ditch by an apparent slide.  No wounds were discovered on Ronald&amp;#39;s body.  He was unharmed for the most part, though when the EMT&amp;#39;s arrived, he claimed to have been shot and attacked by a beast.  No evidence of either were found.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A single black bullet casing was recovered by the turn in, a rolled paper was inside of it with the words:  &amp;quot;Final Score-2/3&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No vehicle was recovered, only the smoldering ashes of a camp fire was found with no other evidence, it seemed that the other campers must have packed up and left without Ronald for some reason.  As for the claims of a creature, no animal was recovered dead or alive from the area described.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No bodies were recovered immediately, though approximately 6 months after these events, a group of Boy Scouts stumbled upon a cave with two bodies, one headless and one intact, both hanging from their ankles, skinned and rotted almost completely, preserved only by the harsh winters that brought tons of snow.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ronald is currently being held in an asylum in Colorado Springs, he is being treated for acute paranoia and schizophrenia, though certain agents of the Fringe Devision of the FBI seem to believe that there maybe some validity to his story.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Dictation by:  Ronald \"Rory\" Jennings \n\nEntered by:  Special Agent Richard \"Dick\" Fisher\n\n---------------------\n\nIt feels like ages, but it's only been thirty-six excruciatingly slow hours since I've been free of that hell hole.  They found me partly buried in a ditch on the side of Interstate 22 in the rural part of no-man's-land, Colorado.  The rain was pounding my face, I could barely see out of one eye, blood had stained my vision.  I clung to the hopes of life by mere threads, praying for salvation...and I am not a religious person.  \n\nIt all began five days ago, when my brother Daniel and my friend Allen DuPrie decided to go out on a camping trip.  The weather was perfect and the opportunity seemed right.  Just three young men in the wilderness, fishing, hunting, drinking until we blacked out...you know...the shit that guys in their early 20's would do.  \n\nWe kissed goodbye to modern society, packing the necessary items in Allen's truck:  a cooler, food for a few days, a tent, sleeping bags, a few lanterns and flashlights, change of clothes, a portable shower, etc.  You know...the normal stuff, no drugs, nothing out of the ordinary.  It took us a few hours, but by 3PM we were well on the road out of Los Vegas, and headed towards the forests of Colorado to make a camp and begin our guys weekend out.  \n\nDaniel was shining his rifle, a beautiful Winchester .223 hunting rifle with a brand new x20 optical zoom scope.  He had made sure to pack it and purchase all of us a hunting license the moment he heard the word \"camping\".  Anything to do with wilderness drove him to break out that gun and shine it until he could practically see his reflection in the wooden stock.  He had also brought our father's old .35 Remmington and a crossbow he had picked up in his last trip to the outdoorsman store by our house.  (The man practically lived at that store, he had worked there for six years before his wife-to-be told him to get a \"real\" job or she was gone).  \n\nA couple of hours passed as Allen drove, the sun began to dive deeper into the Western sky, teasing us with the idea of Friday night ending just a little bit too soon, but bearing the promise of another glorious day on Saturday morning.  Daniel wanted to press on, driving in the near pitch-blackness of the Colorado wilderness claiming \"no one is gonna fuck with three bulky guys and their guns...\" but Allen insisted that we stop for the night, which we did.  \n\nThe motel had a flickering \"Vacant\" sign on the road, barely shining bright enough to catch the eye of a weary traveler, but nonetheless effective in the forbidding darkness of the Interstate.  The sign promised \"Cable TV and Continental Breakfast @ 6:30AM\" along with low rates and a \"happy stay\".  The innkeeper could have passed for a modern-day Norman Bates as we walked in nearing 10:30 at night.  He looked up through his glasses, glaring at us as we interrupted his book which he had, no doubt, read a few hundred times.  He coughed loudly as we entered, welcoming us with a raspy smokers voice and encouraging us to sign the check-in log.  We chatted a bit with him before paying the man, gaining a key to a room and heading off to bed.  \n\nMorning came quickly and Allen, always a penny pincher, woke us at exactly 6AM to claim the continental breakfast before it was all gone.  Daniel and I looked at each other, dragging ourselves up, dressing and leaving the room for the last time to head to check-out.  The concierge was a pretty little dark-haired girl from Tennessee, (i know because I chatted her up a bit), we exchanged pleasantries and talked about the expected weather.  She asked about where we were headed and when we told her, she looked quite shocked.  \n\n\"Haven't Ya'll heard?\"  We shook our heads...\"They say there's some crazy bastard out there who's been killing livestock and living up in them woods.  I wouldn't say it's a safe endeavor if ya'll know what I mean...\"  We exchanged looks of confusion, telling her we would be fine.  She had a certain look in her eyes which I should have taken as a warning, a truthful horrified look, but Daniel wanted to shoot things and Allen wanted his \"damned continental breakfast, not a fucking wive's tale!\"  so we pressed on to the dining room.\n\nWe were back on the road before we knew it, sun rising quickly into the clear skies above the Interstate.  We drove for only a matter of minutes before the trees started to appear, engulfing us quickly and deepening our trench.  After an hour or so, Allen turned off onto a dirt side road, looking for a clearing to camp in...after finding none, he switched his 4-wheel-drive on and created his own route into the forest.  \n\nA little clearing served great for a campsite, and it was about as remote as it could get from the main road.  Nice, private and definitely shooting-safe.  We were absolutely isolated...or so we thought.  \n\nWe set up quickly, unpacking the tent and setting it up, unrolling our sleeping bags, (Allen bitched at me for leaving bug spray at home as the gnats were irritating him a bit), we hung the cooler in a tree to keep bears away and found a save location to site our guns and crossbow before heading off to begin the hunt.  \n\nIt was already close to noon when we trekked off into the wilderness, leaving us only a mere 7 hours of daylight in which to hunt.  We walked quietly through the trees, hoping to find some deer, but none showed.  Daniel, the expert hunter, decided his efforts would be better spent separated from Allen and I, the \"chatterers\" that were the obvious reason the deer had no interest in us.  He climbed up a tree, using a branch as a seat and used his binoculars to look for deer.  Allan joked with him about being \"too army\" for his own good, but received a pinecone to the head before we decided to leave my asshole brother alone and instead find a stream to fish.  \n\nAllen and I headed back towards camp, changing guns for fishing poles and vests for sweat-shirts and hats.  We looked at a map that Allen had used to find this spot, tracing our finger around until we found water about a mile from where we were camped.  We set off and enjoyed an evening of fishing until the stars were well out and we had to walk by torchlight.  \n\nWell as fate would have it, Allen and I snagged a few fish, returning to gloat to Daniel who had...ironically...also snagged some game, a couple of rabbit.  We enjoyed the fresh kills like kings and lay out on lawn chairs until the fire was dying down and the chill of cold set in.  \n\nWe thought we had discovered paradise...but as many have seen before, sometimes paradise is just Hell in disguise.  Nothing really that bad happened the first night...just slightly odd, something Daniel attributed to \"bears\".  We had gutted our animals away from camp to keep predators away, but when we woke the next morning, we found the gut-pile had been moved to our camp side, outside of the clearing of trees...it was found when Daniel went to pee the next morning.  \n\nThe second day brought us even better luck, Daniel scored a deer, and Allen and I brought in more than enough fish to feed an army.  We ensured that the gut pile was buried this time before trekking back into our camp to enjoy the food...this is where things start to get weird.  \n\nWe awoke the next morning to find that the gut pile we had buried were not only in our camp, but some of the intestinal tracks were nailed to the trees...this was definitely not the work of bears.  There were three hearts, two from a fish and one from the deer, in our fire pit.  Blood was spilled in a circle around the outside of the pit.  This should have been enough warning for us, but Daniel decided that this was a game...a ploy by some \"hooligan kids\" to scare us.  He believed that there must be a camp nearby with some drunk college kids who wanted to fuck with us, and he decided that we should get revenge.  \n\nHe grabbed the crossbow from the truck, loading it.  \"We're gonna scare those fuckers really good with this...\" he said aloud, though i'm sure he meant it as a thought...We followed him as he let his \"hunting skills\" take over.  He found a pair of footprints in the dirt and followed them quickly, analyzing their weight and depth.  He murmured to himself about the \"wive's tale\" being more popular than he would have assumed.  A wive's tale...right...\n\nWe followed the trail for what seemed like miles, hours had passed; in fact, the sun was looking towards two or three PM when we finally hit a rocky cliffside.  Daniel swore under his breath and looked straight up...obviously no one had climbed down from there, so someone was screwing with us...this was definitely obvious.  I looked at him, mocking him slightly and told him to take us back to camp so I could make a sandwich.  He angrily agreed and started to lead us back...but stopped dead after 10 minutes...there was no trail to follow, the footprints were gone.  \n\nHe glanced back and admitted that in his hurry, he had forgotten to map it out in his head, but assured us that he knew the road was somewhere to our left and if we walked far enough, we would find it and then be able to walk back to camp....\"a few hours...tops!\" he said.  We, for some stupid reason, agreed to follow him.  After three more hours the sun was starting to stoop behind the trees, darkness was setting in, a perfect hunting time...the prey was blind and less likely to be offensive.  Traps would become less visible and thus the hunters would be less likely to be seen...\n\nPitch blackness followed the long walk, we reached for flashlights that we had genius-ly left at camp.  I swore at my brother, calling him a moron, arguing quite loudly, telling him that he was completely incompetent before Allen told us to both shut up and realize how dangerous the woods were at night.  Luckily, he had brought his binoculars which had a night-vision lens, thus allowing us to progress, but very slowly.  I turned over the reign of leader to Allen, glaring at Daniel as I again remarked that he was a moron.  \n\nOur bickering in the pitch blackness echoed through the trees...Allen did a phenomenal job of ignoring us it seemed, that is, until we realized he wasn't with us...glancing around, Daniel and I searched the nearby trees for him, calling his name loudly...but to no avail.  The darkness is a huge disadvantage, especially in a place so deadly.  \n\nWe sat on the ground for a moment in the silence, listening for Allen...a snap came from somewhere to the left, I jumped...it was a twig.  \"Allen?\" I said slowly, but the growling response that met my ears told me that no, this was not Allen.  I prayed for mercy as I slowly rose and directed my hand to my brother's shoulder, asking him if it was a bear.  He whispered back that it sounded like it...and suggested we back away slowly.  We rose and did...\n\nI heard Daniel's footsteps to my right as we slowly crunched through the leaves and plants...that is until i heard him call out loudly in surprise.  \"Daniel!?\" I shrieked.  He hollered from my right and I walked towards him, bumping right into him by mistake.  He had set foot in a rope-trap that had tightened around his ankle and strung him up in a tree.  \n\nThe growling grew louder, i swear I could see a pair of eyes in the blackness.  I lifted my brother slightly, hoping that the slack would allow him to fall through the rope, I was wrong.  He told me to find a sharp rock and come back to cut him down and I hastily agreed, telling him to be careful.  \n\nMy stumbling solo adventure in the wild scared the living shit of me, i hated being alone in the dark almost as much as i hated being confronted by a bear.  After at least five minutes of searching, I found the perfect rock and began trekking back to Daniel.  As I approached, he was making a gurgling noise, probably something to do with the blood rushing to his head, and I reached up to the rope to cut it.  \n\nHis body hit the floor with a loud THUD, i reached down to touch his face and reassure him, but found myself touching a very sticky, warm substance...He continued gurgling...what the fuck was this?  There was too much for it to be sap...My fingers traced down his chin to his throat where I felt a wound...a large wound...it extended across his throat completely, blood was pouring out of it and down his face.  He looked up at me and grabbed my hand, causing me to jump...he only said one thing before he died...\"Run...\"\n\nA cold chill ran down my spine, no bear had done this, the wound was too perfect, to precise....this was too methodical...I felt a tear run down my cheek as I realized my brother was laying dead at my knees....I pounded on his chest, begging him to come back...but nothing, only a splash of blood on my face.  I stay for what seemed like an eternity before a cold voice came from slightly behind me...\n\n\"He said run...I agree with him, prey is not fun unless it's prey...\"  I jerked my head back in the darkness and was able to make out the form of a towering figure...A roar came from behind him...\"Well? What are you waiting for?  RUN!\"  \n\nA shot pierced the air from the gun in this man's hands.  I rose to my feet, as if obligated and tore off into the night.  \n\nMy feet pounded against the floor as my heart pounded in my chest.  I was praying for help, some form of assistance, but none came.  He must have been hot on my heels as I zig-zagged through the trees and bushes.  If I were lost, surely this stranger would be lost as well.  I ran for a matter of minutes...or maybe it was an hour...but when my body finally gave out on me, i tripped over a rock and face-planted in the mud.  My heart felt like it was about to explode and my muscles were shaking from the adrenaline...I rolled onto my back and looked up into the sky, the moon shone light all around me, and I slowly turned my head, looking around in the partial light for the man, but no one came.  \n\nI breathed a sigh of relief and realized two things, firstly that if I would climb a tree right now, it would significantly increase my chance of surviving him...and his beast....and secondly, that if this water flowing by me was the same river I had been fishing in (we marked our fishing spot), I could find my way back to the car and escape his clutches...\n\nI forced myself up, and found a suitable tree with a branch low enough for me to grab as I climbed up, up, up...almost to the top before I allowed myself to relax, leaning my head back and catching my breath...I was safe, for now.  All I had to do now, was stay awake...with my eyes open...not falling asleep....not drifting.....off.....\n\nThe sunlight woke me up, I heard the birds chattering in the skyline, the echo of a woodpecker came from somewhere in the distance.  I glanced at my wrist for the time, but realized I had left my watch and phone in the truck...I forced myself to stretch...such a weird dream to have...but then I caught a glimpse of my hands...soaked in blood, caked in fact.  The sadness filled my heart...followed closely by a stern fear.  I looked around on the ground and saw no one. \n\nAfter a few minutes of surveillance, I decided to risk it...My feet hit the ground with a thud.  I shook leaves off of me and walked towards the stream.  The blood stained the water a slight red as it trickled downstream, it was caked on hard so it took a while to get it off.  \n\nI caught a glimpse of my reflection and realized I was more covered in blood that I had initially thought...the wound must have been bad.  I had to get back to the truck and call 9-1-1, someone had to know of last night's events....but where the fuck was I? \n\nI looked around me, I was surrounded by trees, a call of a bird of sorts broke the silence, the water trickled down a hill..this was not near my fishing spot, but I did remember seeing a few hills slightly North of our spot.  I decided to follow the water, hoping it would lead me to my salvation...and I was right.  \n\nWithin an hour and a half, I came across the familiar spot that Allen and I had been fishing, we had marked the tree nearest to it with an arrow...it was still there, but as I got closer...I noticed that there was something under it...a paper....\n\n\"Dear sirs, though we have not been properly introduced I would like to inform you that you are currently being hunted.  I will not tell you my name, nor my reasons...let's just say that humanity provides the ultimate game...should you attempt to leave, I have rigged a...treat...for you on the exit route...I hope you've enjoyed your stay in these woods, because they will be your FINAL resting place!\" \n\nA bloody handprint with the small side note \"SCORE: 1/3\" was at the bottom.  This guy was clearly nuts...and as it seemed, the wive's tales weren't so false after all...I would have to mock Daniel later....then I remembered...Tears filled my eyes...I began to realize I would never see my brother alive again....\n\nAs my tears streamed, I heard a familiar voice...\"Rory?\"  I looked up to see Allen standing a mere few feet from me, covered in dirt.  I looked up at him, he was bewildered and obviously had wandered all night.  He had bags under his eyes and was looking worse for wear.  I asked him what had happened the previous night and he shrugged...\"Donno really, all I remember was holding the crossbow, walking and...bam I woke up hanging in a tree somewhere...\"  \n\nI told him of Daniel's demise and he hugged me...after a while we decided to walk back to the campsite...but carefully as to not trigger any more...traps.  As we walked, the sun beat down on our faces, reddening our skin.  I could smell BO emulating from under my sweatshirt...I removed it and threw it into a bush as we walked...\n\nAfter a while, we arrived at the camp site...it was exactly as we had left it...except for one thing:  there was a large pole in the fire pit we had dug...and on that pole was a human skull...the bone was washed clean of any flesh, it was perfectly white...I stared into it, a feeling of knowing filled my heart, that was Daniel...As we approached it, his mouth was agape with the same look of terror that had probably filled his heart the previous night...i noticed that there were a pair of glass eyeballs fitted into the eye-sockets.  They stared at me as though piercing my soul, begging me for an explanation...why had I left him?  Why hadn't i stopped that crazy son-of-a-bitch?  \n\nI removed his skull from the pole and held it in my hands...\n\nHave you ever held a loved one's head in your hands?  It's actually a terrifying feeling to know that you possess a part of someone's lifeless body that was so invigorated and full of life less than 7 hours ago...I couldn't help but feel a pang of remorse again as I held him...\n\nAllen looked at me and suggested we keep moving, told me that we should change clothes, eat and keep moving before the psycho caught us.  By my logic, he should have been asleep because he had spent the entirety of the previous night hunting us, killing my brother and then removing his flesh before repositioning it on a pole in the center of our camp, KNOWING we would return eventually and find it.  I suggested that because of this, we needed rest to trek on without dying of exhaustion...and I was in need of a shower.  Allen reluctantly agreed...\n\nI again awoke, this time in the tent, with the sound of birds around me...how could mother nature be such a fickle bitch?  My brother was dead...his head in a bag next to me...yet life carried on as if nothing had happened...I unzipped the tent and walked outside, hoping to find Allen waiting...and waiting he was. \n\n\"Hey bud, did you catch some sleep?\"  I asked...but no reply.  The sun beat down on him, silhouetting him in a perfect manner.  I approached him slowly...\"Allen?  You are awake right?\"  I didn't want to scare him, he had fallen asleep with a rifle in his hand and I had no aim to wake him and get shot in the face.  I circled around slowly, allowing for a better angle of his face when I saw it...\n\nThe side of the tent was coated in fresh blood \"SCORE 2/3\" was painted...No...I walked to Allen...\"Allen?\" I reached forward to touch him and found his skull pierced by a single, low caliber round...how had i not heard it?  His throat was slit like my brother's and blood had poured into his lap.  The hunter obviously took great pride in his methodology of murder, quickly claiming a victim before leaving them to bleed out.  He had been expecting us...but why?\n\nI knelt by Allen's body before I heard the crackle of bushes moving...a large beast...nothing I had ever seen before...crawled out, teeth exposed.  It's flesh was hard like a rhinoceros, it's teeth were long and sharp...almost tiger-like.  It arched it's back ready to pounce as it sniffed the air...it was not looking directly at me, but had it's head cocked to one side...the creature must be blind.  \n\n\"Now now Tabby...we musn't spoil our dinner with a light snack...after all, you've gotta save some room for dessert...\"  A calm, collected voice came from the shadows behind the bush and a towering figure pushed through it.  He was bald, face hidden by an old style gas mask, a face painted onto it in what appeared to be blood.  He was wearing a large grey pleather apron, streaks of blood covered it and splashed onto his camo-pants which were neatly tucked into his combat boots...this man was so stuck in a rut it was no wonder he was after us.  \n\nHe calmly walked into the camp and the creature purred loudly, retreating into the shadows.  He obviously was smirking with a mischievous and evil face behind that mask.  He approached me and sat in one of our lawn chairs.  \"Don't worry, I'm not here to kill you...\"  He chuckled dryly.  \"No, no...I'm just here to offer you congratulations on succeeding in surviving the longest...and to warn you...\"  \n\n\"Warn me?\" I asked, my voice now quivering with fear, his mask was seriously freaking me out.  \n\n\"Yes...to warn you...come nightfall, you and I...we will not be as friendly, you will have exactly 2 hours to run as far as you can before I come for you...and if you do not succeed...you will die.\"  He reached into his pocket and tossed me a watch.  \"Time's ticking Rory...don't waste it...\"  He rose without another word and walked towards the edge of the camp.  \"Oh...and don't try anything stupid.  The car is rigged to blow and guns will prove less than effective on me...\"  \n\nLike a spirit of sheer evil, he vanished into the shadows, the creature following his beck and call.  I shuddered with anxiety...I had to escape... I had to get away.  I did what any rational human being would do...pocketed the watch, grabbed a bottle of water, a flashlight and a hunting knife and turned into the woods, running as fast as my legs would carry me.  \n\nSomething told me I was headed the right way, while something else called to me softly, telling me I had no idea where the fuck I was and without Daniel or Allen, I was doomed...even with them I was still in a very bad position.  \n\nI forced myself to run faster, harder, farther....pushing past the pain and ragged breathing.  I dug deep in my spirit, egging myself on and after a rather long twenty minutes, I finally lost my edge and slowed to a jog...then to a walking pace.  The trees taunted me, a mysterious maze created from such peace and serenity.  Like a torture chamber I was trapped inside, a rat in a lab searching for cheese.  \n\nI stopped and looked around, hoping for any sign of a landmark..but none met my eyes.  I started walking more, hoping to stumble across something, but only dirt, trees and bushes met my eyes while the call of the wild filled my ears.  I swore under my breath and drew long and hard on the water.  \n\nI glanced at the time...I was only that much closer to my demise, I had to keep going.  I swear I could hear the creature rustling in the bushes, the deep breathing behind that archaic mask...but when I would turn, nothing but empty trees and deepened shadows would greet me.  My pulse was racing, my fear was gripping me...I knew I had little chance of survival.  \n\nNight came quickly, and a dense fog began to settle in around me, further disorienting me...If I had any shred of hope to find the road to safety, it was now completely shattered...crumbled to ashes and flung to the dogs.  I drew my knife, hoping to ward off the creature should it come for me, but only silence filled the air around me.  \n\nI continued my path, hoping it was true, and found a soft dirt below my feet begin to harden...I had found what appeared to be a road!  I clicked on my light, finding that I had indeed discovered a dirt road..the same one we came in on!  My heart jumped in my throat, filling me with a sense of protection, guidance and survival I needed to go on.  I noticed a small sign near the turn we had made, an arrow pointed forward claiming there was a ranger station only a mere three miles up the road...it was better to head there than to head back towards the concrete...or was it?  I had seen neither head nor hide of a ranger this entire time...I was now faced with a serious decision, head for the station or head back to the road...something told me to take my chances on the paved surface, that way I would at least have the chance of hitting civilization at some point.  \n\nI turned around and began my journey back to paved road.  The dirt was slippery under my feet, tough to my shoes and crunched loudly in the empty trench that served as a road.  I kept following it, when a thought popped into my head...that psycho was still out here...wearing his old mask...with that creature and I was in the wide open wilderness....I needed to correct this, so I turned slightly off the road, paralleling it by a mere ten or fifteen feet and continued to walk through the brush and trees, hoping the fog and foliage gave me enough cover.  \n\nI glanced at the watch, reading it by flashlight, it read: 01:29:22AM.  I decided that at this pace, I would reach the concrete by 3AM...after all, we had driven in pretty slowly.  \n\nMy guess was right and my luck had turned around, a pair of headlight streamed across the turn off quickly, at around 75MPH, obviously a civilian vehicle...I was probably a good half a mile from it, but still better off than the ranger station.  \n\nAt 2:45:01AM I was only a quarter mile, when my heart jumped with glee.  I was free of that bastard's clutches, free to call for help and free to escape once and for all!  That was when I heard it...the shot...\n\nA small caliber bullet ripped my ankle hard, forcing me to the ground.  My face hit the dirt and I heard his heavy breathing oh-so-close behind me.  I writhed in pain for a moment when I heard the creature shriek with excitement.  \n\n\"Now now, calm down, he's not yet done!\"  Called the voice.  I heard another shot ring out, a ricochet pinged off the hard-packed dirt nearby.  I swore and forced myself up.  If this asshole wanted me dead, i wanted someone to find my body.  I forced myself to limp towards the road as quickly as I could...hobbling on a shattered ankle.  \n\nHe chuckled lightly from 20 feet behind me, firing yet another shot into the foggy darkness...it clipped my shoulder, ripping flesh from my arm and burning a painful slice into the meat.  I grabbed it and shouted in agony...yelling at the top of my voice, hoping that a passerby would hear my calls and stop, but no one was coming...\n\nThe darkness deepened as my flashlight hit the floor, my wounds were bleeding badly and I was in need of a hospital, but I pressed on, kicking up dirt as I hobbled onward...the road was so close...yet so far.  \n\nA light rain had begun and my nostrils were filled with the odor of wet concrete, I knew it was no more than 100 feet away, in fact, i could almost make out the shape in the darkness.   90 feet and closing...\n\nI heard another shot ring out, this one absorbed by a nearby tree.  \"You'll not get away so easily boy!\"  The voice was now angry, the creature was anxious and ready to pounce, but he kept the reigns as he reloaded his weapon.  \"One more shot my precious, then you can have yours...\"  \n\nI was gaining speed as I hobbled closer...how had this man killed two but could not kill me?  Perhaps the fog?  I was wondering almost out loud as I hobbled on.  50 feet and closing.  I could see a trench ahead that was virtually on the road...if I could just get to it.  I ducked back into the trees to help cover me from his rain of gunfire.  \n\nI could feel the closeness as I hobbled on.  I was no more than 20 feet at this point when I heard the final round rip through the air...It made contact with the small of my back and pushed me hard to the ground.  I cried out...NO! I would NOT be beaten.  I forced myself up...\n\nHe swore and cried out in disbelief....\"Get him!\"  The creature, faster than I would have anticipated, galloped towards me.  I drew the knife and turned as it jumped.  I felt it's claws dig into my shoulders and it's teeth grew close to my face as I force its mouth open with my bare hands.  The knife hung sideways from my fingers and I rolled slightly, allowing myself to grip it at I released the creature's mouth.  It snapped into the dirt and roared in my ear.  \n\nI forced the knife into it's flesh and drew it back, blood dripped on to my face.  It shrieked in pain, recoiling and preparing to strike with its paw when I swung again, this time colliding with its throat.  Blood virtually squirted out with a force of a garden hose...It gurgled and wandered around confused for a moment when I heard another shot...this one not intended for me...\n\nThe creature went down hard and stayed down....the gas mask was literally within hand's reach away and he turned to me intimidatingly.  He dropped his gun, and unhooked his mask with one hand.  Removing it, I immediately cried out in horror.  \n\nHe had no face...literally.  The blank places his eyes belonged were literally holes, nostrils were carved into a bleached bone...his jaw was slacked and mouth was open in a horrible grin.  He laughed with a hoarse laugh...though intimidating, he was way less horrifying with the fucking mask on.  \n\nHis hand closed around my throat, he brought me close to his face and his voice echoed in my very soul:  \"This...THIS is the face of death!\"  He threw me hard into the darkness, my body flying with a superhuman propulsion...I landed on hard concrete, my skull striking it...I was dazed..badly...\n\nI watched in horror while fading in and out of consciousness as he walked towards me.  I tried to stand and could not.  He smirked a wicked smile as he approached.  When he stood directly over me, he glared down into my face, a burning fire in the holes where his eyes should be.  \n\n\"You...you have been spared...a brush with death and yet you still fight....you are the ultimate game...and as a hunter, I will allow you to walk...\"  With that, his boot came down hard on my temple and I blacked out....\n\n--------------------------\n\nA ranger passing by noticed the body on the side of the road, almost buried in the ditch by an apparent slide.  No wounds were discovered on Ronald's body.  He was unharmed for the most part, though when the EMT's arrived, he claimed to have been shot and attacked by a beast.  No evidence of either were found.  \n\nA single black bullet casing was recovered by the turn in, a rolled paper was inside of it with the words:  \"Final Score-2/3\".  \n\nNo vehicle was recovered, only the smoldering ashes of a camp fire was found with no other evidence, it seemed that the other campers must have packed up and left without Ronald for some reason.  As for the claims of a creature, no animal was recovered dead or alive from the area described.  \n\nNo bodies were recovered immediately, though approximately 6 months after these events, a group of Boy Scouts stumbled upon a cave with two bodies, one headless and one intact, both hanging from their ankles, skinned and rotted almost completely, preserved only by the harsh winters that brought tons of snow.  \n\nRonald is currently being held in an asylum in Colorado Springs, he is being treated for acute paranoia and schizophrenia, though certain agents of the Fringe Devision of the FBI seem to believe that there maybe some validity to his story.

If the book averages two or more footnotes per page, think twice and justify its inclusion. Secondary and tertiary sources are &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; favored: this is for general readers. Feel free to ignore these suggestions, but include reasons for why you are ignoring it (ie, &amp;quot;This is an academic work, but is highly readable&amp;quot;). As Agentdcf pointed out, we don&amp;#39;t want this turning into the &amp;quot;History&amp;quot; section at the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, but also bare in mind that these works should be accessible both in terms of content and in terms of availability. Anything, however, is acceptable with sufficient justification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the West Rules, for Now&lt;/em&gt; by Ian Morris: An excellent overview of both Western and Eastern history. Morris combines a readable style and an ability to explain historical concepts in an easy manner with a historian&amp;#39;s rigor. An excellent introduction to the topic of historical studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Little History of the World&lt;/em&gt; by Ernst Gombrich. It is essentially a summary of human history to around the 1930s. I read this when I was younger - it&amp;#39;s aimed perfectly at interested children, and manages to be accessible and entertaining without being condescending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cities&lt;/em&gt; by John Reader. A social history of the development of cities - particularly good chapters on the Renaissance and Mexico City stick in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winchester&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; is a very interesting history of the Atlantic Ocean, and particularly of the relationship between Britain and the Americas. It is somewhat similar to Kurlansky and Bryson&amp;#39;s work but still enjoyable. Winchester has also written a book on the invention of the dictionary - I haven&amp;#39;t read it but it&amp;#39;s supposed to be excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip the Second&lt;/em&gt; by Fernand Braudel: Possibly the most important work of history of the 20th cen. I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t argue this, but my point is the case can and has been made. It&amp;#39;s a major major work -- and tremendously written. When we talk about Jared Diamond, we&amp;#39;re talking about big, long, slow processes as determining the shape of history. That&amp;#39;s Braudel, in a nutshell--except he tried to deal with everything from trade, warfare, religion, urbanism, naval technology, culture, individual agency, etc. He may not have succeeded in explaining everything, but he literally changed the game in France in the 1950s and 60s (and 70s in America, when his work was translated into English).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Empires of the Word&lt;/em&gt; by Nicholas Oster: A great work of general world history for the general public. Exploring history through the lens of languages give a new perspective on many eras. As a bonus, a historian&amp;#39;s work is often based around reading primary sources - knowing why the primary sources are in a particular language helps you appreciate them all the more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prize&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Yergin: Describes the history of the oil industry beginning in the 1800s through the 1990s. Combines many historical narrative types to create a sweeping, global narrative of how oil has impacted all aspects of society. Particularly good at explaining the science aspect of the oil industry--how oil is found and produced, how oil varies from region to region, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historiography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Owns Antiquity?&lt;/em&gt; by James Cuno. Title is self-explanatory - discusses issues of nationality and imperialism in the management of historical artefacts. The author is making an argument against nationalistic retention, but still provides a very good overview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Landscape of History&lt;/em&gt; John Lewis Gaddis: If you are interested in how History and Historians view the world around them and the world of the past this is for you. You&amp;#39;ll often hear references to &amp;#39;thinking like a lawyer&amp;#39; or some other profession. Gaddis sums up what it means to think like a historian. He also provides a strong line in the sand between historical inquiry and the social sciences and I personally enjoyed him sort of tearing into the objectivity and the &amp;#39;scientific&amp;#39; approach that social scientists shroud themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is History&lt;/em&gt; E. H. Carr: Read this for the same reason you would read Gibbon&amp;#39;s decline and fall. Its extremely eloquent and flat out beautiful in its prose at times. E H Carr was a leading man in the historical field in the mid 20th century. He treads a middle line between empiricism and idealism. To quote from a review &amp;#39;Arguably the central ideas in the book constitute today&amp;#39;s mainstream thinking on British historical practice&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History: A very short introduction&lt;/em&gt; John H Arnold: Its short. Its less a true &amp;#39;historiography&amp;#39; in that it doesn&amp;#39;t get into method or theory and is more a history of history. Again I will quote a far more able reviewer.\n&amp;quot;This is an extremely engaging book, lively, enthusiastic and highly readable, which presents some of the fundamental problems of historical writing in a lucid and accessible manner. As an invitation to the study of history it should be difficult to resist.&amp;quot;--Peter Burke, Emmanuel College, Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Noble Dream: The &amp;quot;Objectivity Question&amp;quot; and the American Historical Profession&lt;/em&gt; by Peter Novick. Addresses the naivete of the ideal of objectivity. A nice complement to Gaddis in some respects, though Gaddis is probably the better volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern History&lt;/strong&gt;--The study of history beginning with the 19th century globalization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;East Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Modern History of Japan&lt;/em&gt; by Andrew Gordon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War without Mercy&lt;/em&gt; by John Dower is pretty much the best comparative look at race and ideology in the Pacific War. It&amp;#39;s long and a bit academic, but there&amp;#39;s none better. (WWII)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;America&amp;#39;s Geisha Ally&lt;/em&gt; by Naoko Shibusawa Is a very readable account of the cultural and media politics of the US occupation of Japan. It examines the transformation of Japan from implacable enemy to &amp;quot;geisha ally&amp;quot; in US eyes, and in doing so, explains much of Japan&amp;#39;s current relationship with the US. (US occupation of Japan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader&lt;/em&gt; by Bradley K. Martin: It blends into journalism by the end (plenty of descriptions of current happenings), but his explanations of Japanese occupation, revolution and Kim Il-Sung&amp;#39;s rise to power was quite good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Embracing Defeat&lt;/em&gt; by John Dower: The benchmark book on immediate postwar culture in Japan. It is a bit more readable than War Without Mercy. (Immediate Post-WWII)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rearranging the Landscape of the Gods&lt;/em&gt; by Sarah Thal: Nominally this work is about the Konpira Shrine and its changes from the late Sengoku to the modern world. But it goes far deeper, and provides a vivid illustration of the extraordinary changes in Japanese socity, particularly during the tumultuous times after the Meiji Restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Europe/&amp;quot;The West&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cod and Salt&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Kurlansky are similar to Bryson - both use a somewhat obscure but still fascinating subject matter to narrate the rise of America (among other things). His work is very readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Balkans&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Mazower: A Brief Summary of Balkan history to the present day, but nevertheless very insightful. A great starting point to see why people tend to have been wrong about the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yugosavia: Twice there was a Country&lt;/em&gt; by John Lampe: A great overview of the turbulent 20th century and the brief existence of a Yugoslav state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postwar: A history of Europe since 1945&lt;/em&gt; by Tony Judt: Very detailed and good overview of Europe&amp;#39;s post war history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm&lt;/em&gt; by Miranda Carter: A very good account of the politics leading up to WWI; Carter&amp;#39;s thesis is that the actions of George V of England, Nicholas II of Russia, and Wilhelm of Germany had repercussions and led the countries to war. It helps if you have an understanding of late 19th century politics, but it&amp;#39;s not necessary. Carter&amp;#39;s writing is pretty scholarly, but I caught myself laughing a few times while reading - really readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin&lt;/em&gt; by Timothy Snyder. Very readable account of the events in countries caught between the Soviet Union and Hitler&amp;#39;s Germany during the beginnings of WWII, starting with Ukraine&amp;#39;s Holodomor and the political tensions that rose from Stalin&amp;#39;s paranoia of outside influence during those events. Really gives you a sense of the suffering of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dictators&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Overy. This is not quite a readable as Snyder, but a very well-written and well-documented comparative history of the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, highly recommended for the enthusiast already familiar with the general details of each regime&amp;#39;s history and wanting to really gain an understanding of their similarities and differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State&lt;/em&gt; by Satter. Very readable and recent history of the rise of the criminal influence in Russian government following the downfall of the Soviet Union. Really uses his understanding of Russian psychology gained by years as the Moscow correspondent for the WSJ to give insight into what happened and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three books by Richard Pipes: &lt;em&gt;Russia Under the Old Regime, The Russian Revolution&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime&lt;/em&gt;. Pipes has a somewhat conservative take on events, but the writing clearly quarantines his opinion away from his facts, and, well, for someone who still remembers standing in line around the block for stale bread in winter of &amp;#39;92, like myself, his harsh criticism is not unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Russian Revolution&lt;/em&gt; by Sheila Fitzpatrick is a shorter summary of the Revolution which is extremely readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia&lt;/em&gt; by Davis Hoffman. A very well-written account of the rise of the current Russian inner-circle in the highest echelons of power under Putin in the years during the downfall of the Soviet Union. Starts with short biographies of the 6 main players in this history, and then gives a fascinating detailed account of their accumulation of and fights for power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;North America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1861: The Civil War Awakening&lt;/em&gt; by Adam Goodheart: A popular history book that discusses the mood of the nation in the lead-up to the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age&lt;/em&gt; by Kevin Boyle: Winner of a National Book Award, this book is a great introduction to housing discrimination and racial tensions in Detroit in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory&lt;/em&gt; by Ben Robertson: Provides a history of the upcountry of South Carolina as memoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion&lt;/em&gt; by Peter H. Wood: Discusses the early history of African slaves in Colonial South Carolina to the plantation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Glorious Cause&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Middlekauf: Rather by definition the master book on the Revolution. Not formative or revolutionary in its approach, but a comprehensive look at the entire war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Killed Canadian History?&lt;/em&gt; - Jack Granatstein. If you want to go in to any depth in Canadian history, reading Granatstein is a must. This is one of his more controversial books, it&amp;#39;s always under fire from other scholars, which makes it an interesting read about Canadian history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Empire Within&lt;/em&gt; - Sean Mills. Important because it provides detailed information about the rise, and existence of the FLQ. Important to show that Quebec has a distinct history from the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Towards Defining the Prairies: Region, Culture, and History. A Collection of Essays about the Canadian West&lt;/em&gt; from Gerald Friesen to W.C. Morton. Way more academic. Shows how unique the Canadian west is, and much like Quebec, how it has its own distinct history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Adams&lt;/em&gt; by David McCullough: Very readable account of an often misunderstood man. Particularly great at juxtaposing Adams&amp;#39;s vanity with his genuine belief in the ideas of the American Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle Cry of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; by James McPherson: Widely considered as the seminal one-volume work on the Civil War period, focusing holistically on the economic, social, political, and military aspects of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxford History of the United States&lt;/em&gt; series, of which I don&amp;#39;t think I have seen anything negative written about any of the books in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963&lt;/em&gt; by Taylor Branch: a Pulitzer Prize winning book detailing, as the title implies, the civil rights movement in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle East&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict:&lt;/em&gt; a history with documents by Smith. This is a nice, concise history of the conflict that contains accessible documents that are relevant to the previous section. It is largely low-bias and perfectly captures both sides of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkey: A Modern History&lt;/em&gt; by Zurcher. This book, while lacking in primary source references in some spots, is the most expansive modern history of a country that I&amp;#39;ve ever read. It manages it&amp;#39;s events in a clear way, and connects the important events to the overall history of the middle east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A History of the Arab Peoples&lt;/em&gt;: Albert Hourani, a classic in the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Modern Middle East: A History&lt;/em&gt; James Gelvin, I think this book wants to avoid being a textbook but ends up in the same place, but does it better and in fewer pages than Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire&lt;/em&gt; M. Şükrü Hanioğlu, because none of the other synthetic histories of the late Ottoman Empire are as brief or succinctly worded as this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Osman&amp;#39;s Dream: A History of the Ottoman Empire&lt;/em&gt; by Caroline Finkel: the best, and really only, single-volume history of the OE. Most of the rest are a snore to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Quiet Revolution: The First Palestinian Intifada and Nonviolent Resistance&lt;/em&gt; by Mary E. King:\nThe title is fairly self explanatory, but I think it gives a good analysis of the events. Also the focus on the non-violence movement and its effect are frequently missing from the popular discourse on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years&lt;/em&gt; by Bernard Lewis -This is a very readable book by the fields leading scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Axworthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rule Of Experts: Egypt, Technopolitics and Modernity&lt;/em&gt; by Timothy Mitchell: an innovative take on the history of the modern world in eight interlocking essays about Egypt in the 20th century which deal with everything from land surveys to the plagiarisms of mid-century anthropology to a history of the Aswan Dam from the perspective of a mosquito. This book challenges traditional ways of talking about history by deemphasizing human agency and focusing on the formative power of knowledge practices and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History&lt;/em&gt; by Thomas Barfield: Broad history detailing the political changes that have taken place within Afghanistan over the past few centuries, along with a readable description of the various ethnic groups residing within the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the Shah&amp;#39;s Men&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen Kinzer: A great read about the overthrow of Iran&amp;#39;s shah, the role of the U.S. in that coup, and the eventual rise of the revolutionary movement in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western Eurasia&lt;/strong&gt;--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from Mesopotamian agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Near East&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persian Fire&lt;/em&gt; by Tom Holland: is a really great introduction, whilst also being a great book about Greek History at the same time. Now, because he is deliberately constructing a comprehensive world for readers he is having to fill in quite a few gaps, and in my opinion not always correctly. But nonetheless his style of writing will leave you with a very clear image of the cultures he writes about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise and Fall of Egypt&lt;/em&gt; by Toby Wilkinson It&amp;#39;s very well written with a superb narrative style and from an academic perspective its predominantly spot on. It tends to gloss over some of the debates which are still ongoing but only to maintain a cohesive narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Twilight of Ancient Egypt&lt;/em&gt; by Karol Mysliwiec. It covers the cultural melting pot in the Nile valley quite nicely and is very accessible in terms of style. Not quite as general a history as Toby Wilkinson though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tomb in Ancient Egypt&lt;/em&gt; by Salima Ikram: which is comprehensive and full of beautiful pictures to properly track evolution of funerary culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete Pyramids&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Lehner: Of a similar ilk but more focused on the old kingdom complexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bible Unearthed&lt;/em&gt; by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written. Just be a little bit careful, Finkelstein works in his &amp;quot;low chronology&amp;quot; without preface, which is good for his inteded audience, but bad for a broader view, as it remains contentious. It&amp;#39;s worth picking up Grabbe&amp;#39;s book to help spot where he does so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Did God Have a Wife *by William Dever. Dever has a decidedly more conservative flair, but trumps other more conservative scholars by being an archaeologist, and--for the most part--giving the archaeology priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel&amp;#39;s History and the History of Israel&lt;/em&gt; by Mario Liverani. Liverani stands out as being perhaps the truest scholar of the Ancient Near East generally to write on the history of Israel, and this is valuable on that basis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ancient Israel: What do we know and how do we know it?&lt;/em&gt; by Lester Grabbe. Despite the somewhat colloquial feel of the title, this is not light reading. Nor is it intended to be, it provides a succinct, easily understandable discussion of all of the major debates in Israelite archaeology today. It wonderfully fills a fairly obvious gap for a quick and dirty reference for recent discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical History and Israel&amp;#39;s Past&lt;/em&gt;, Megan B. Moore and Brad E. Kelle (2011). I can&amp;#39;t say enough about how fantastic this book is. The breadth and accessibility of this overview of the current state of research is incredible. The suggested reading at the end of each chapter provides a wonderful selection of equally readable texts (at least among ones I&amp;#39;ve read). Just. . .fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Classical Civilization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Age Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World of the Celts&lt;/em&gt; by Simon James: Provides a condensed overview of the Celtic world including everything from theoretical beginnings to the idea of modern Celts and from fighting Rome to farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention&lt;/em&gt; by Simon James: A very short book which outlines the development of the Celtic &amp;quot;myth.&amp;quot; Its conclusions are fairly controversial, but some very interesting light is shone on the creation of national identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thundering Zeus: The Making of Hellenistic Bactria, by Frank L. Holt&lt;/em&gt; (1999): It&amp;#39;s quite a current book, it&amp;#39;s well researched, it&amp;#39;s a great introduction to Bactria and to Central Asia as an entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Samarkhand to Sardis&lt;/em&gt;, by Susan Sherwin White and Amelie Kuhrt. It&amp;#39;s very well written, it introduced the approach of looking at the Hellenistic world and Seleucid Empire in their own right as opposed to just an extension of Classical Greece, and it is very comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Rome Fell&lt;/em&gt; by Adrian Goldsworthy: Goldsworthy is the author of numerous works of popular history and is very familiar with the form. He provides and excellent and detailed narrative, as well as an analysis focused on political systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fires of Vesuvius&lt;/em&gt; by Mary Beard: Readable and lively, Beard captures the vivacious character of Pompeii along with providing an introduction to the field of classical archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rubicon&lt;/em&gt; by Tom Holland: A great read that really brings Republican Rome to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome&lt;/em&gt; by Arthur Eckstein: I&amp;#39;m probably biased because Dr. Eckstein is one of my professors, but this book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadn&amp;#39;t really been explored extensively yet. Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances, rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period - something he argues was not unique to Rome at all, nor were they &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; at it than anyone, as was the prevailing theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fall of Rome and End of Civilization&lt;/em&gt; by Bryan Ward-Perkins: A work that has quickly become a standard, it uses archaeology to provocatively draw a harsh line between the Roman and post-Roman world. It also functions as an excellent introduction to archaeology and the Roman economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medieval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Year 1000&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: a fascinating narrative history of the year 1000. It is short and certainly aimed at a mass market but still informative and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploring the World of the Vikings&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Hall: Written by the former head of the archaeological digs in York, it&amp;#39;s the best and most up-to-date overview of the Viking age. It&amp;#39;s a bit archaeology-heavy, but in that field that&amp;#39;s a must, due to the basically non-existing genuine historical tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land&lt;/em&gt; by Thomas Asbridge: Asbridge is one of the leading modern scholars of the crusades, and this books is not only expansive in its scope, covering the crusading movement from genesis to the aftermath of the fall of Acre, but it is also quite readable. Plus it&amp;#39;s quite inexpensive for a scholarly work. Heavily focused on the Third Crusade, particularly on Saladin and Richard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire&lt;/em&gt; by Edward Luttwak. Luttwak focuses on the general narrative of Byzantium in this book. He spends time detailing the military, social, political, and cultural realities of the Byzantine Empire and outlines why it was able to function as long as it did in spite of a great many internal and external stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History&lt;/em&gt; by Norman F. Cantor: he is able to explain the schism of the Catholic church very well, as well as the various societies. He also presents a theory on why Eastern Europe opposed the use of icons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early Modern&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natasha&amp;#39;s Dance&lt;/em&gt; by Orlando Figes is a very readable record of Russian history and cultural identity, from Peter the Great to the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Origins of Modern Europe 1660-1789 by James L. White. Readable summary of European history during that period - I&amp;#39;ve only used a few chapters for papers but it was extremely useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crucible of War: The Seven Years&amp;#39; War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766&lt;/em&gt; by Fred Anderson: It was a great book about the events that proceeded (and Anderson asserts helped to bring about) the American Revolution while also touching upon the broader war between Britain and France throughout the world (Havana, the Philippines, India, Europe). But don&amp;#39;t be fooled, this is mainly focused on the invasion of Canada and what would become the Midwest and the immediate aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806&lt;/em&gt; by Jonathan Israel: An impressive scholarly well-documented account of the history of the Low Countries (in relation to the rest of Early Modern Europe). Yet, very accessible for the general reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rise of Modern Warfare 1618-1815&lt;/em&gt; by H.W. Koch: Absolutely full of etchings, portraits, and diagrams. Divided into several sections based on country: England, France, Russia, etc., as well as general discussion of modern warfare. Each section discusses uniform, armament, and tactics. Suitable for in-depth study or just looking at the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Russian history, anything by Robert Massie. &lt;em&gt;Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, The Romanovs.&lt;/em&gt; Very readable, well-written, well-researched, very detailed and in-depth and yet never boring accounts of Russian history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of Russia&lt;/em&gt; by Vernadsky. A readable overview of Russian history from Kievan Rus&amp;#39; through WWII, if you get one of the later editions (the earliest edition was published in 1929). Much better written than Riasanovsky&amp;#39;s still-in-print book of the same name, which I could never understand why people enjoy reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Return of Martin Guerre&lt;/em&gt; by Natalie Zemon Davis: Heavy archival research backs an exploration of common culture in a 16th-century French village. Particularly present are questions of identity, evidence, and community. This is a very popular work by a celebrated American cultural historian of early modern France&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller&lt;/em&gt; by Carlo Ginzburg: The author uses archival research to address questions of how common people lived in early modern (northern) Italy. The book offers a glimpse of the ways common people participated in the discourse of ideas in counter-reformation Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early Modern Colonial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick&lt;/em&gt; - a very good book about the founding of Plymouth Plantation, and the first 50 years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mayflower Bastard&lt;/em&gt; - An interesting book, about a young boy on the Mayflower, and his life afterwards up to and including the Salem Witch Trials. The style of the book is offputting to some, and the author has been criticised for including too much supposition, but it is worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Savage Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; by Benjamin Woolley - a very well written account of the Jamestown colony, including a lot of detailed build up explaining the background to the colony&amp;#39;s founding. Almost as much of the book is set in England as it is in the new colony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Chief Elizabeth&lt;/em&gt; by Giles Milton - Giles Milton is definitely popular, rather than academic, history, but he has a great readable style and his books seem to be well researched. This book is about the precursors to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, including the lost colony of Roanoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Island at the Centre of the World&lt;/em&gt; by Russell Shorto - the story of the founding of New York (New Amsterdam) based on 17th century Dutch records which have only recently been discovered/translated. An extremely good book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Voyage Long and Strange&lt;/em&gt; by Anthony Horowitz - a popular history book about early European colonisation attempts of America, before the successful Jamestown colony. Written as a semi-travelogue by the author, but an interesting read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age of Reconnaissance&lt;/em&gt; by J. H. Parry: A formidable classic on the Western Expansion and the age of exploration. Parry provides a dense but excellent description of how the west was able to conquer and their motivations. His section on the development of scientific navigation is particularly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East Asian History&lt;/strong&gt;--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from the Yellow River Valley&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China: A New History&lt;/em&gt; by John K. Fairbank: An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology. China&amp;#39;s modern history is the main concern, but the earlier periods are treated sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Search for Modern China&lt;/em&gt; by Jonathan Spence. It&amp;#39;s a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late 1980s. Covers all the bases. Nothing is covered in exceptional depth (with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book) but for a general idea of recent Chinese history it&amp;#39;s more than adequate. Also, a very readable book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A History of Chinese Civilization&lt;/em&gt; by Jacques Gernet: A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods. It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history, and at times the details of the political history get ignored, but any survey this ambitious must make cuts. The account of the nineteenth century is particularly vivid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&amp;#39;s Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Edward Lewis: Divided between sections on history, geography, the economy, society, and culture, this book is comprehensive without being overloaded--whether your interests are agriculture, the status of women, or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here. It also does well at torpedoing national mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As We Saw Them&lt;/em&gt; by Masao Miyoshi is a highly readable account of the first Japanese mission to the west. It offers an interesting reversal of the typical narrative of Westerners observing inscrutable &amp;quot;Orientals.&amp;quot; (1860)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civilization and Monsters&lt;/em&gt; by Gerald Figal: an academic book, but extremely readable (in my opinion- the one amazon reviewer disagrees). Its central thesis that discourse on monsters, ghosts, the supernatural was central to the formation of modern Japan is surprisingly innovative, and fun to read. (Meiji period)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mongolia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World&lt;/em&gt;: Entertaining, interesting and good for history geeks and the general population. There are some misrepresentations that the author makes, and I also think that he relies on the Secret History a little too much, but all in all, awesome!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Asian History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modern South Asia&lt;/em&gt; by Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal: A very concise (less than 200 pages of narrative) history of South Asia from around 1600 CE onward. A very accessible and complete explanation of British colonialism in South Asia with a well-rounded perspective of the subsequent nationalist movements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native American Peoples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-Columbian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1491&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Mann: A popular history book that covers the general history of Native Americans until European contact. It discusses both North and South America. Although Mann is not a professional historian, his work is very thought-provoking and approachable for a lay-audience. He also has a follow-up book, 1493, which covers interactions between Europeans and Native Americans post-contact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post-Columbian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cherokee Cases&lt;/em&gt; This book isn&amp;#39;t too difficult, and it adds in a great deal about President Jackson, which is always a crowd pleaser. Although, this might sadden a great deal of Jackson lovers. This book details the politics behind Worcester v Georgia and Cherokee Nation v Georgia, which are the cornerstones of Native American Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custer Died For Your Sins&lt;/em&gt; by Vine Deloria Jr: This book went a long way in shifting the focus of Anthropology and History away from Indians as objects and victims towards Indians as active participants. Written in 1969, I make sure students read this before they are allowed to talk about Native History. Indians have fantastic senses of humor, and this book really shows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Landscape Traveled by Coyote and Crane&lt;/em&gt; by Rodney Frey: This is is a representation of the perfect way in which to work with tribes to do Anthropology and History. He uses old stories and modern stories told by living Coeur d&amp;#39;Alene people to contextualize everything he writes. He involves the Coeur d&amp;#39;Alene people without losing his focus or professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation&lt;/em&gt; by John Ehle: A very readable history of the Cherokee Nation. It follows the life of John Ridge, a Cherokee leader whose rise and fall parallels that of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural/Intellectual History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus&amp;#39;s Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich&lt;/em&gt; by Christopher B. Krebs: Provides an interesting history of Tacitus&amp;#39;s Germania from contextualizing its writing to how it was sought after in Renaissance Italy to how it was eventually used for propaganda purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey&lt;/em&gt; by Kenneth Ch&amp;#39;en: An excellent history of Chinese Buddhism, including its intellectual development and the societal reactions to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life&lt;/em&gt; by Jacques Barzun: A magisterial work of cultural history, an end-of-life summa penned by one of the most civilized men ever to exist. It&amp;#39;s both scholarly and accessible, narrated in gorgeous prose, and deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Thucydides, Tacitus, Gucciardini, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Burckhardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pioneers of Photography&lt;/em&gt; by Aaron Scharf. Contains personal writings of Nicephore Niepce, the inventor of the first photograph, as well as biographies of other pioneers and an in-depth discussion of their techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picture Machine: The Rise of American Newspictures&lt;/em&gt; by William Hannigan and Ken Johnston. While mostly a collection of photographs, there is a very nice preface that discusses the adoption of photography by newspaper companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hippie&lt;/em&gt; by Barry Miles: An excellent, detailed history of the counter culture from 1965-71 in both England and the U.S, from Ken Kesey and the Magic Bus, to the music scenes, to hippies, and Vietnam protests, he covers a lot. Also, there are a lot of pretty pictures and it looks great on a coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy&lt;/em&gt; by Paula Findlen: This book looks at the development of scientific culture in Europe, using early modern (northern) Italy as a case study. Cultural forces like patronage and identity have large roles in proto-scientific circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in America&lt;/em&gt; by Elizabeth Fraterrigo and Bachelors and Bunnies: The Sexual Politics of Playboy by Carrie Pitzulo - both excellent books about not only Playboy magazine, but also postwar culture, American consumerism, and shifting gender roles in the 1960s and 1970s. You don&amp;#39;t even have to have read Playboy to understand them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Expedition: Stanley&amp;#39;s Mad Journey Through the Congo&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Liebowitz and Charles Pearson: This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Exploration. Stanley represents the end of the colonial explorer because of the intense and frightening stories brought back to England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the Edge of the World&lt;/em&gt; by Laurence Bergreen: Bergreen is not a professional historian, but he presents the story of Magellan&amp;#39;s circumnavigation in an entertaining way. He doesn&amp;#39;t add anything new to the table, but I can respect someone who can take primary documents and make them enjoyable to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longitude&lt;/em&gt; by Dava Sobel: This book details how the world figured to procedure of finding longitudinal coordinates in the world. Great Britain offered a huge cash prize to anyone able to work out a way to find longitude. Without a way to track longitude reliably, ships had been getting lost and running aground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Worst Journey in the World&lt;/em&gt; by Apsley Cherry-Gerrard: This is a first hand account written by one of the scientist on the expedition to the South Pole. The book is impressive because of how disastrous and pointless their expedition turn out. Terrific examples of the conditions near the pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terrorism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al-Qaeda&lt;/em&gt; by Gerard Chaliand and Arnaud Blin: Two French scholars trace the path of terrorism from the ancient world to the present day, with a particularly lucid section differentiating terrorism from other acts of violence. (academic)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A History of Terrorism&lt;/em&gt; by Walter Laqueur: Another broad history of terrorism. Laqueur takes an interesting stance, arguing that history and the social sciences can&amp;#39;t accurately explain terrorism; instead, he believes studying literature is the best method for arriving at accurate conclusions about the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Terrorism&lt;/em&gt; by Bruce Hoffman: Maybe considered the best work on terrorism. Holistic study explaining the era of modern terrorism (1968-present), with particularly adept analysis of the relationship between the media and terrorist groups. (academic)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;/em&gt; by Lawrence Wright: Excellent narrative history of the birth and rise of al-Qaeda, told mainly through multiple biographies of the key players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies&lt;/em&gt; by Jeremy Varon: A comparative work detailing the similarities and differences of German and American society in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as between the two terrorist organizations.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christianity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Historical Figure of Jesus&lt;/em&gt; by E P Sanders. A popularization of his important work Jesus and Judaism. Intended for non-specialists, which may find the former incomprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Historical Jesus: Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant&lt;/em&gt; by John Crossan. I personally disagree with pretty well every word Crossan writes. But even when he&amp;#39;s wrong, he&amp;#39;s wonderfully productive. A contrast to Sanders view, representing two sides of one of the major debates of the last quarter century or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul: A Very Short Introduction&lt;/em&gt; by E P Sanders Sanders&amp;#39; work on Paul in his more academic books revolutionized Pauline studies over the last half century. The VSI series is always excellent, and this is no exception. A wonderful introduction to recent work on Paul and the so-called &amp;quot;New Perspective on Paul.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pasteurization of France&lt;/em&gt; by Bruno Latour: I think Latour does a good job at showing the social and cultural prerequisites necessary to encourage the French to accept Pasteur&amp;#39;s microbes as revealed truth, as well as the process by which these conditions are obscured in favor of the &amp;quot;Great Man&amp;quot; thesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England&lt;/em&gt; by Steve Shapin: Shapin deftly argues that the practice of science in seventeenth-century England relied heavily on the reliable word of &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; in a particular field, as experiments were expensive and laborious to reproduce. Trust emerges as a critical element in the production of scientific knowledge, and Shapin demonstrates that what we assume to be objective in science often rests on this foundation of trust in the scientist (as it does in every academic field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism&lt;/em&gt; by Mario Biagioli: Biagioli shows how crucial the patron/client relationship was for scientists in early modern Europe - particularly for Galileo and his principal patron, Pope Urban VIII. Again, this is another work that unpacks the social networks that undergird(ed) scientific study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectivity&lt;/em&gt; by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison: The book traces a critical problem of representation in the Scientific Revolution, particularly relating to representing objects of scientific study in atlases. For example: when making an entry for oak trees in a botany book, what kind of picture should one include? No two oak trees will look the same (though they will look similar), so how does the artist draw it so that it can be easily recognized in real life by referencing the atlas? How do you draw something like cloud formations in an atlas to demonstrate the difference between Cirrus and Cumulus clouds, even though clouds are constantly changing shape? Daston and Galison do a great job explaining the context of these debates and anxieties and what they reveal about the practice of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"This is for \"above average\" general readers. If the book averages two or more footnotes per page, think twice and justify its inclusion. Secondary and tertiary sources are *strongly* favored: this is for general readers. Feel free to ignore these suggestions, but include reasons for why you are ignoring it (ie, \"This is an academic work, but is highly readable\"). As Agentdcf pointed out, we don't want this turning into the \"History\" section at the Barnes &amp; Noble, but also bare in mind that these works should be accessible both in terms of content and in terms of availability. Anything, however, is acceptable with sufficient justification.\n\nSo, without further ado:\n\n**General**\n\n1. *Why the West Rules, for Now* by Ian Morris: An excellent overview of both Western and Eastern history. Morris combines a readable style and an ability to explain historical concepts in an easy manner with a historian's rigor. An excellent introduction to the topic of historical studies.\n\n2. *A Little History of the World* by Ernst Gombrich. It is essentially a summary of human history to around the 1930s. I read this when I was younger - it's aimed perfectly at interested children, and manages to be accessible and entertaining without being condescending.\n\n3. *Cities* by John Reader. A social history of the development of cities - particularly good chapters on the Renaissance and Mexico City stick in my mind.\n\n4. Winchester's *Atlantic* is a very interesting history of the Atlantic Ocean, and particularly of the relationship between Britain and the Americas. It is somewhat similar to Kurlansky and Bryson's work but still enjoyable. Winchester has also written a book on the invention of the dictionary - I haven't read it but it's supposed to be excellent.\n\n5. *The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip the Second* by Fernand Braudel: Possibly the most important work of history of the 20th cen. I probably wouldn't argue this, but my point is the case can and has been made. It's a major major work -- and tremendously written. When we talk about Jared Diamond, we're talking about big, long, slow processes as determining the shape of history. That's Braudel, in a nutshell--except he tried to deal with everything from trade, warfare, religion, urbanism, naval technology, culture, individual agency, etc. He may not have succeeded in explaining everything, but he literally changed the game in France in the 1950s and 60s (and 70s in America, when his work was translated into English).\n\n6. *Empires of the Word* by Nicholas Oster: A great work of general world history for the general public. Exploring history through the lens of languages give a new perspective on many eras. As a bonus, a historian's work is often based around reading primary sources - knowing why the primary sources are in a particular language helps you appreciate them all the more.\n\n7. *The Prize* by Daniel Yergin: Describes the history of the oil industry beginning in the 1800s through the 1990s. Combines many historical narrative types to create a sweeping, global narrative of how oil has impacted all aspects of society. Particularly good at explaining the science aspect of the oil industry--how oil is found and produced, how oil varies from region to region, etc.\n\n**Historiography**\n\n1. *Who Owns Antiquity?* by James Cuno. Title is self-explanatory - discusses issues of nationality and imperialism in the management of historical artefacts. The author is making an argument against nationalistic retention, but still provides a very good overview.\n\n2. *The Landscape of History* John Lewis Gaddis: If you are interested in how History and Historians view the world around them and the world of the past this is for you. You'll often hear references to 'thinking like a lawyer' or some other profession. Gaddis sums up what it means to think like a historian. He also provides a strong line in the sand between historical inquiry and the social sciences and I personally enjoyed him sort of tearing into the objectivity and the 'scientific' approach that social scientists shroud themselves in.\n\n3. *What is History* E. H. Carr: Read this for the same reason you would read Gibbon's decline and fall. Its extremely eloquent and flat out beautiful in its prose at times. E H Carr was a leading man in the historical field in the mid 20th century. He treads a middle line between empiricism and idealism. To quote from a review 'Arguably the central ideas in the book constitute today's mainstream thinking on British historical practice'.\n\n4. *History: A very short introduction* John H Arnold: Its short. Its less a true 'historiography' in that it doesn't get into method or theory and is more a history of history. Again I will quote a far more able reviewer.\n\"This is an extremely engaging book, lively, enthusiastic and highly readable, which presents some of the fundamental problems of historical writing in a lucid and accessible manner. As an invitation to the study of history it should be difficult to resist.\"--Peter Burke, Emmanuel College, Cambridge\n\n5. *That Noble Dream: The \"Objectivity Question\" and the American Historical Profession* by Peter Novick. Addresses the naivete of the ideal of objectivity. A nice complement to Gaddis in some respects, though Gaddis is probably the better volume.\n\n**Modern History**--The study of history beginning with the 19th century globalization.\n\n*East Asia*\n\n1. *A Modern History of Japan* by Andrew Gordon\n\n2. *War without Mercy* by John Dower is pretty much the best comparative look at race and ideology in the Pacific War. It's long and a bit academic, but there's none better. (WWII)\n\n3. *America's Geisha Ally* by Naoko Shibusawa Is a very readable account of the cultural and media politics of the US occupation of Japan. It examines the transformation of Japan from implacable enemy to \"geisha ally\" in US eyes, and in doing so, explains much of Japan's current relationship with the US. (US occupation of Japan)\n\n3. *Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader* by Bradley K. Martin: It blends into journalism by the end (plenty of descriptions of current happenings), but his explanations of Japanese occupation, revolution and Kim Il-Sung's rise to power was quite good.\n\n4. *Embracing Defeat* by John Dower: The benchmark book on immediate postwar culture in Japan. It is a bit more readable than War Without Mercy. (Immediate Post-WWII)\n\n5. *Rearranging the Landscape of the Gods* by Sarah Thal: Nominally this work is about the Konpira Shrine and its changes from the late Sengoku to the modern world. But it goes far deeper, and provides a vivid illustration of the extraordinary changes in Japanese socity, particularly during the tumultuous times after the Meiji Restoration.\n\n*Europe/\"The West\"*\n\n1. *Cod and Salt* by Mark Kurlansky are similar to Bryson - both use a somewhat obscure but still fascinating subject matter to narrate the rise of America (among other things). His work is very readable.\n\n2. *The Balkans* by Mark Mazower: A Brief Summary of Balkan history to the present day, but nevertheless very insightful. A great starting point to see why people tend to have been wrong about the Balkans.\n\n3. *Yugosavia: Twice there was a Country* by John Lampe: A great overview of the turbulent 20th century and the brief existence of a Yugoslav state.\n\n4. *Postwar: A history of Europe since 1945* by Tony Judt: Very detailed and good overview of Europe's post war history.\n\n5. *George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm* by Miranda Carter: A very good account of the politics leading up to WWI; Carter's thesis is that the actions of George V of England, Nicholas II of Russia, and Wilhelm of Germany had repercussions and led the countries to war. It helps if you have an understanding of late 19th century politics, but it's not necessary. Carter's writing is pretty scholarly, but I caught myself laughing a few times while reading - really readable.\n\n*Eastern Europe*\n\n1. *Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin* by Timothy Snyder. Very readable account of the events in countries caught between the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany during the beginnings of WWII, starting with Ukraine's Holodomor and the political tensions that rose from Stalin's paranoia of outside influence during those events. Really gives you a sense of the suffering of the people.\n\n2. *The Dictators* by Richard Overy. This is not quite a readable as Snyder, but a very well-written and well-documented comparative history of the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, highly recommended for the enthusiast already familiar with the general details of each regime's history and wanting to really gain an understanding of their similarities and differences.\n\n3. *Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State* by Satter. Very readable and recent history of the rise of the criminal influence in Russian government following the downfall of the Soviet Union. Really uses his understanding of Russian psychology gained by years as the Moscow correspondent for the WSJ to give insight into what happened and why.\n\n4. Three books by Richard Pipes: *Russia Under the Old Regime, The Russian Revolution* and *Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime*. Pipes has a somewhat conservative take on events, but the writing clearly quarantines his opinion away from his facts, and, well, for someone who still remembers standing in line around the block for stale bread in winter of '92, like myself, his harsh criticism is not unjustified.\n\n5. *The Russian Revolution* by Sheila Fitzpatrick is a shorter summary of the Revolution which is extremely readable.\n\n6. *The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia* by Davis Hoffman. A very well-written account of the rise of the current Russian inner-circle in the highest echelons of power under Putin in the years during the downfall of the Soviet Union. Starts with short biographies of the 6 main players in this history, and then gives a fascinating detailed account of their accumulation of and fights for power.\n\n*North America*\n\n1. *1861: The Civil War Awakening* by Adam Goodheart: A popular history book that discusses the mood of the nation in the lead-up to the Civil War.\n\n2. *Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age* by Kevin Boyle: Winner of a National Book Award, this book is a great introduction to housing discrimination and racial tensions in Detroit in the early part of the 20th century.\n\n3. *Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory* by Ben Robertson: Provides a history of the upcountry of South Carolina as memoirs.\n\n4. *Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion* by Peter H. Wood: Discusses the early history of African slaves in Colonial South Carolina to the plantation period.\n\n5. *The Glorious Cause* by Robert Middlekauf: Rather by definition the master book on the Revolution. Not formative or revolutionary in its approach, but a comprehensive look at the entire war.\n\n6. *Who Killed Canadian History?* - Jack Granatstein. If you want to go in to any depth in Canadian history, reading Granatstein is a must. This is one of his more controversial books, it's always under fire from other scholars, which makes it an interesting read about Canadian history.\n\n7. *The Empire Within* - Sean Mills. Important because it provides detailed information about the rise, and existence of the FLQ. Important to show that Quebec has a distinct history from the rest of the country.\n\n8. *Towards Defining the Prairies: Region, Culture, and History. A Collection of Essays about the Canadian West* from Gerald Friesen to W.C. Morton. Way more academic. Shows how unique the Canadian west is, and much like Quebec, how it has its own distinct history.\n\n9. *John Adams* by David McCullough: Very readable account of an often misunderstood man. Particularly great at juxtaposing Adams's vanity with his genuine belief in the ideas of the American Revolution.\n\n10. *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James McPherson: Widely considered as the seminal one-volume work on the Civil War period, focusing holistically on the economic, social, political, and military aspects of the time.\n\n11. *Oxford History of the United States* series, of which I don't think I have seen anything negative written about any of the books in the series.\n\n12. *Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963* by Taylor Branch: a Pulitzer Prize winning book detailing, as the title implies, the civil rights movement in the United States.\n\n*Middle East*\n\n1. *Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict:* a history with documents by Smith. This is a nice, concise history of the conflict that contains accessible documents that are relevant to the previous section. It is largely low-bias and perfectly captures both sides of the debate.\n\n2. *Turkey: A Modern History* by Zurcher. This book, while lacking in primary source references in some spots, is the most expansive modern history of a country that I've ever read. It manages it's events in a clear way, and connects the important events to the overall history of the middle east.\n\n3. *A History of the Arab Peoples*: Albert Hourani, a classic in the discipline.\n\n4. *The Modern Middle East: A History* James Gelvin, I think this book wants to avoid being a textbook but ends up in the same place, but does it better and in fewer pages than Cleveland.\n\n5. *A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire* M. Şükrü Hanioğlu, because none of the other synthetic histories of the late Ottoman Empire are as brief or succinctly worded as this one.\n\n6. *Osman's Dream: A History of the Ottoman Empire* by Caroline Finkel: the best, and really only, single-volume history of the OE. Most of the rest are a snore to read.\n\n7. *A Quiet Revolution: The First Palestinian Intifada and Nonviolent Resistance* by Mary E. King:\nThe title is fairly self explanatory, but I think it gives a good analysis of the events. Also the focus on the non-violence movement and its effect are frequently missing from the popular discourse on the matter.\n\n8. *The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years* by Bernard Lewis -This is a very readable book by the fields leading scholar.\n\n9. *A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind* by Michael Axworthy\n\n10. *Rule Of Experts: Egypt, Technopolitics and Modernity* by Timothy Mitchell: an innovative take on the history of the modern world in eight interlocking essays about Egypt in the 20th century which deal with everything from land surveys to the plagiarisms of mid-century anthropology to a history of the Aswan Dam from the perspective of a mosquito. This book challenges traditional ways of talking about history by deemphasizing human agency and focusing on the formative power of knowledge practices and technology.\n\n11. *Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History* by Thomas Barfield: Broad history detailing the political changes that have taken place within Afghanistan over the past few centuries, along with a readable description of the various ethnic groups residing within the country.\n\n12. *All the Shah's Men* by Stephen Kinzer: A great read about the overthrow of Iran's shah, the role of the U.S. in that coup, and the eventual rise of the revolutionary movement in the region.\n\n**Western Eurasia**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from Mesopotamian agriculture.\n\n*Near East*\n\n1. *Persian Fire* by Tom Holland: is a really great introduction, whilst also being a great book about Greek History at the same time. Now, because he is deliberately constructing a comprehensive world for readers he is having to fill in quite a few gaps, and in my opinion not always correctly. But nonetheless his style of writing will leave you with a very clear image of the cultures he writes about. \n\n2. *Rise and Fall of Egypt* by Toby Wilkinson It's very well written with a superb narrative style and from an academic perspective its predominantly spot on. It tends to gloss over some of the debates which are still ongoing but only to maintain a cohesive narrative.\n\n3. *The Twilight of Ancient Egypt* by Karol Mysliwiec. It covers the cultural melting pot in the Nile valley quite nicely and is very accessible in terms of style. Not quite as general a history as Toby Wilkinson though.\n\n4. *The Tomb in Ancient Egypt* by Salima Ikram: which is comprehensive and full of beautiful pictures to properly track evolution of funerary culture. \n\n5. *Complete Pyramids* by Mark Lehner: Of a similar ilk but more focused on the old kingdom complexes.\n\n6. *The Bible Unearthed* by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written. Just be a little bit careful, Finkelstein works in his \"low chronology\" without preface, which is good for his inteded audience, but bad for a broader view, as it remains contentious. It's worth picking up Grabbe's book to help spot where he does so.\n\n7. *Did God Have a Wife *by William Dever. Dever has a decidedly more conservative flair, but trumps other more conservative scholars by being an archaeologist, and--for the most part--giving the archaeology priority.\n\n8. *Israel's History and the History of Israel* by Mario Liverani. Liverani stands out as being perhaps the truest scholar of the Ancient Near East generally to write on the history of Israel, and this is valuable on that basis alone.\n\n9. *Ancient Israel: What do we know and how do we know it?* by Lester Grabbe. Despite the somewhat colloquial feel of the title, this is not light reading. Nor is it intended to be, it provides a succinct, easily understandable discussion of all of the major debates in Israelite archaeology today. It wonderfully fills a fairly obvious gap for a quick and dirty reference for recent discoveries.\n\n10. *Biblical History and Israel's Past*, Megan B. Moore and Brad E. Kelle (2011). I can't say enough about how fantastic this book is. The breadth and accessibility of this overview of the current state of research is incredible. The suggested reading at the end of each chapter provides a wonderful selection of equally readable texts (at least among ones I've read). Just. . .fantastic.\n\n\n*Classical Civilization*\n\n*Iron Age Europe*\n\n1. *The World of the Celts* by Simon James: Provides a condensed overview of the Celtic world including everything from theoretical beginnings to the idea of modern Celts and from fighting Rome to farming practices.\n\n2. *The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention* by Simon James: A very short book which outlines the development of the Celtic \"myth.\" Its conclusions are fairly controversial, but some very interesting light is shone on the creation of national identities.\n\n\n*Greece*\n\n1. *Thundering Zeus: The Making of Hellenistic Bactria, by Frank L. Holt* (1999): It's quite a current book, it's well researched, it's a great introduction to Bactria and to Central Asia as an entity.\n\n2. *From Samarkhand to Sardis*, by Susan Sherwin White and Amelie Kuhrt. It's very well written, it introduced the approach of looking at the Hellenistic world and Seleucid Empire in their own right as opposed to just an extension of Classical Greece, and it is very comprehensive.\n\n\n*Rome*\n\n1. *Why Rome Fell* by Adrian Goldsworthy: Goldsworthy is the author of numerous works of popular history and is very familiar with the form. He provides and excellent and detailed narrative, as well as an analysis focused on political systems.\n\n2. *The Fires of Vesuvius* by Mary Beard: Readable and lively, Beard captures the vivacious character of Pompeii along with providing an introduction to the field of classical archaeology.\n\n3. *Rubicon* by Tom Holland: A great read that really brings Republican Rome to life.\n\n4. *Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome* by Arthur Eckstein: I'm probably biased because Dr. Eckstein is one of my professors, but this book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadn't really been explored extensively yet. Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances, rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period - something he argues was not unique to Rome at all, nor were they \"better\" at it than anyone, as was the prevailing theory.\n\n5. *The Fall of Rome and End of Civilization* by Bryan Ward-Perkins: A work that has quickly become a standard, it uses archaeology to provocatively draw a harsh line between the Roman and post-Roman world. It also functions as an excellent introduction to archaeology and the Roman economy.\n\n\n*Medieval*\n\n1. *The Year 1000* by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: a fascinating narrative history of the year 1000. It is short and certainly aimed at a mass market but still informative and entertaining.\n\n2. *Exploring the World of the Vikings* by Richard Hall: Written by the former head of the archaeological digs in York, it's the best and most up-to-date overview of the Viking age. It's a bit archaeology-heavy, but in that field that's a must, due to the basically non-existing genuine historical tradition.\n\n3. *The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land* by Thomas Asbridge: Asbridge is one of the leading modern scholars of the crusades, and this books is not only expansive in its scope, covering the crusading movement from genesis to the aftermath of the fall of Acre, but it is also quite readable. Plus it's quite inexpensive for a scholarly work. Heavily focused on the Third Crusade, particularly on Saladin and Richard.\n\n4. *The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire* by Edward Luttwak. Luttwak focuses on the general narrative of Byzantium in this book. He spends time detailing the military, social, political, and cultural realities of the Byzantine Empire and outlines why it was able to function as long as it did in spite of a great many internal and external stressors.\n\n5. *The Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History* by Norman F. Cantor: he is able to explain the schism of the Catholic church very well, as well as the various societies. He also presents a theory on why Eastern Europe opposed the use of icons.\n\n*Early Modern*\n\n1. *Natasha's Dance* by Orlando Figes is a very readable record of Russian history and cultural identity, from Peter the Great to the Soviet Union.\n\n2. *The Origins of Modern Europe 1660-1789 by James L. White. Readable summary of European history during that period - I've only used a few chapters for papers but it was extremely useful.*\n\n3. *Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766* by Fred Anderson: It was a great book about the events that proceeded (and Anderson asserts helped to bring about) the American Revolution while also touching upon the broader war between Britain and France throughout the world (Havana, the Philippines, India, Europe). But don't be fooled, this is mainly focused on the invasion of Canada and what would become the Midwest and the immediate aftermath.\n\n4. *The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806* by Jonathan Israel: An impressive scholarly well-documented account of the history of the Low Countries (in relation to the rest of Early Modern Europe). Yet, very accessible for the general reader.\n\n5. *The Rise of Modern Warfare 1618-1815* by H.W. Koch: Absolutely full of etchings, portraits, and diagrams. Divided into several sections based on country: England, France, Russia, etc., as well as general discussion of modern warfare. Each section discusses uniform, armament, and tactics. Suitable for in-depth study or just looking at the pictures.\n\n6. For Russian history, anything by Robert Massie. *Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, The Romanovs.* Very readable, well-written, well-researched, very detailed and in-depth and yet never boring accounts of Russian history.\n\n7. *History of Russia* by Vernadsky. A readable overview of Russian history from Kievan Rus' through WWII, if you get one of the later editions (the earliest edition was published in 1929). Much better written than Riasanovsky's still-in-print book of the same name, which I could never understand why people enjoy reading.\n\n8. *The Return of Martin Guerre* by Natalie Zemon Davis: Heavy archival research backs an exploration of common culture in a 16th-century French village. Particularly present are questions of identity, evidence, and community. This is a very popular work by a celebrated American cultural historian of early modern France\n\n9. *The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller* by Carlo Ginzburg: The author uses archival research to address questions of how common people lived in early modern (northern) Italy. The book offers a glimpse of the ways common people participated in the discourse of ideas in counter-reformation Italy.\n\n*Early Modern Colonial*\n\n1. *Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick* - a very good book about the founding of Plymouth Plantation, and the first 50 years afterwards.\n\n2. *Mayflower Bastard* - An interesting book, about a young boy on the Mayflower, and his life afterwards up to and including the Salem Witch Trials. The style of the book is offputting to some, and the author has been criticised for including too much supposition, but it is worth a read.\n\n3. *Savage Kingdom* by Benjamin Woolley - a very well written account of the Jamestown colony, including a lot of detailed build up explaining the background to the colony's founding. Almost as much of the book is set in England as it is in the new colony.\n\n4. *Big Chief Elizabeth* by Giles Milton - Giles Milton is definitely popular, rather than academic, history, but he has a great readable style and his books seem to be well researched. This book is about the precursors to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, including the lost colony of Roanoke.\n\n5. *The Island at the Centre of the World* by Russell Shorto - the story of the founding of New York (New Amsterdam) based on 17th century Dutch records which have only recently been discovered/translated. An extremely good book.\n\n6. *A Voyage Long and Strange* by Anthony Horowitz - a popular history book about early European colonisation attempts of America, before the successful Jamestown colony. Written as a semi-travelogue by the author, but an interesting read.\n\n7. *The Age of Reconnaissance* by J. H. Parry: A formidable classic on the Western Expansion and the age of exploration. Parry provides a dense but excellent description of how the west was able to conquer and their motivations. His section on the development of scientific navigation is particularly good.\n\n**East Asian History**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from the Yellow River Valley\n\n*China*\n\n1. *China: A New History* by John K. Fairbank: An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology. China's modern history is the main concern, but the earlier periods are treated sufficiently.\n\n2. *The Search for Modern China* by Jonathan Spence. It's a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late 1980s. Covers all the bases. Nothing is covered in exceptional depth (with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book) but for a general idea of recent Chinese history it's more than adequate. Also, a very readable book.\n\n3. *A History of Chinese Civilization* by Jacques Gernet: A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods. It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history, and at times the details of the political history get ignored, but any survey this ambitious must make cuts. The account of the nineteenth century is particularly vivid.\n\n4. *China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty* by Mark Edward Lewis: Divided between sections on history, geography, the economy, society, and culture, this book is comprehensive without being overloaded--whether your interests are agriculture, the status of women, or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here. It also does well at torpedoing national mythology.\n\n*Japan*\n\n1. *As We Saw Them* by Masao Miyoshi is a highly readable account of the first Japanese mission to the west. It offers an interesting reversal of the typical narrative of Westerners observing inscrutable \"Orientals.\" (1860)\n\n2. *Civilization and Monsters* by Gerald Figal: an academic book, but extremely readable (in my opinion- the one amazon reviewer disagrees). Its central thesis that discourse on monsters, ghosts, the supernatural was central to the formation of modern Japan is surprisingly innovative, and fun to read. (Meiji period)\n\n*Mongolia*\n\n1. *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World*: Entertaining, interesting and good for history geeks and the general population. There are some misrepresentations that the author makes, and I also think that he relies on the Secret History a little too much, but all in all, awesome!\n\n**South Asian History**\n\n1. *Modern South Asia* by Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal: A very concise (less than 200 pages of narrative) history of South Asia from around 1600 CE onward. A very accessible and complete explanation of British colonialism in South Asia with a well-rounded perspective of the subsequent nationalist movements.\n\n**Native American Peoples**\n\n*Pre-Columbian*\n\n1. *1491* by Charles Mann: A popular history book that covers the general history of Native Americans until European contact. It discusses both North and South America. Although Mann is not a professional historian, his work is very thought-provoking and approachable for a lay-audience. He also has a follow-up book, 1493, which covers interactions between Europeans and Native Americans post-contact.\n\n*Post-Columbian*\n\n1. *The Cherokee Cases* This book isn't too difficult, and it adds in a great deal about President Jackson, which is always a crowd pleaser. Although, this might sadden a great deal of Jackson lovers. This book details the politics behind Worcester v Georgia and Cherokee Nation v Georgia, which are the cornerstones of Native American Law.\n\n2. *Custer Died For Your Sins* by Vine Deloria Jr: This book went a long way in shifting the focus of Anthropology and History away from Indians as objects and victims towards Indians as active participants. Written in 1969, I make sure students read this before they are allowed to talk about Native History. Indians have fantastic senses of humor, and this book really shows it.\n\n3. *Landscape Traveled by Coyote and Crane* by Rodney Frey: This is is a representation of the perfect way in which to work with tribes to do Anthropology and History. He uses old stories and modern stories told by living Coeur d'Alene people to contextualize everything he writes. He involves the Coeur d'Alene people without losing his focus or professionalism.\n\n4. *Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation* by John Ehle: A very readable history of the Cherokee Nation. It follows the life of John Ridge, a Cherokee leader whose rise and fall parallels that of the nation.\n\n**Cultural/Intellectual History**\n\n1. *A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich* by Christopher B. Krebs: Provides an interesting history of Tacitus's Germania from contextualizing its writing to how it was sought after in Renaissance Italy to how it was eventually used for propaganda purposes.\n\n2. *Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey* by Kenneth Ch'en: An excellent history of Chinese Buddhism, including its intellectual development and the societal reactions to it.\n\n3. *From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life* by Jacques Barzun: A magisterial work of cultural history, an end-of-life summa penned by one of the most civilized men ever to exist. It's both scholarly and accessible, narrated in gorgeous prose, and deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Thucydides, Tacitus, Gucciardini, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Burckhardt.\n\n4. *Pioneers of Photography* by Aaron Scharf. Contains personal writings of Nicephore Niepce, the inventor of the first photograph, as well as biographies of other pioneers and an in-depth discussion of their techniques.\n\n5. *Picture Machine: The Rise of American Newspictures* by William Hannigan and Ken Johnston. While mostly a collection of photographs, there is a very nice preface that discusses the adoption of photography by newspaper companies.\n\n6. *Hippie* by Barry Miles: An excellent, detailed history of the counter culture from 1965-71 in both England and the U.S, from Ken Kesey and the Magic Bus, to the music scenes, to hippies, and Vietnam protests, he covers a lot. Also, there are a lot of pretty pictures and it looks great on a coffee table.\n\n7. *Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy* by Paula Findlen: This book looks at the development of scientific culture in Europe, using early modern (northern) Italy as a case study. Cultural forces like patronage and identity have large roles in proto-scientific circles.\n\n8. *Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in America* by Elizabeth Fraterrigo and Bachelors and Bunnies: The Sexual Politics of Playboy by Carrie Pitzulo - both excellent books about not only Playboy magazine, but also postwar culture, American consumerism, and shifting gender roles in the 1960s and 1970s. You don't even have to have read Playboy to understand them!\n\n*Exploration*\n\n1. *The Last Expedition: Stanley's Mad Journey Through the Congo* by Daniel Liebowitz and Charles Pearson: This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Exploration. Stanley represents the end of the colonial explorer because of the intense and frightening stories brought back to England.\n\n2. *Over the Edge of the World* by Laurence Bergreen: Bergreen is not a professional historian, but he presents the story of Magellan's circumnavigation in an entertaining way. He doesn't add anything new to the table, but I can respect someone who can take primary documents and make them enjoyable to read.\n\n3. *Longitude* by Dava Sobel: This book details how the world figured to procedure of finding longitudinal coordinates in the world. Great Britain offered a huge cash prize to anyone able to work out a way to find longitude. Without a way to track longitude reliably, ships had been getting lost and running aground.\n\n4. *The Worst Journey in the World* by Apsley Cherry-Gerrard: This is a first hand account written by one of the scientist on the expedition to the South Pole. The book is impressive because of how disastrous and pointless their expedition turn out. Terrific examples of the conditions near the pole.\n\n*Terrorism*\n\n1. *The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al-Qaeda* by Gerard Chaliand and Arnaud Blin: Two French scholars trace the path of terrorism from the ancient world to the present day, with a particularly lucid section differentiating terrorism from other acts of violence. (academic)\n\n2. *A History of Terrorism* by Walter Laqueur: Another broad history of terrorism. Laqueur takes an interesting stance, arguing that history and the social sciences can't accurately explain terrorism; instead, he believes studying literature is the best method for arriving at accurate conclusions about the phenomenon.\n\n3. *Inside Terrorism* by Bruce Hoffman: Maybe considered the best work on terrorism. Holistic study explaining the era of modern terrorism (1968-present), with particularly adept analysis of the relationship between the media and terrorist groups. (academic)\n\n4. *The Looming Tower* by Lawrence Wright: Excellent narrative history of the birth and rise of al-Qaeda, told mainly through multiple biographies of the key players.\n\n5. *Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies* by Jeremy Varon: A comparative work detailing the similarities and differences of German and American society in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as between the two terrorist organizations.*\n\n*Christianity*\n\n1. *The Historical Figure of Jesus* by E P Sanders. A popularization of his important work Jesus and Judaism. Intended for non-specialists, which may find the former incomprehensible.\n\n2. *The Historical Jesus: Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant* by John Crossan. I personally disagree with pretty well every word Crossan writes. But even when he's wrong, he's wonderfully productive. A contrast to Sanders view, representing two sides of one of the major debates of the last quarter century or so.\n\n3. *Paul: A Very Short Introduction* by E P Sanders Sanders' work on Paul in his more academic books revolutionized Pauline studies over the last half century. The VSI series is always excellent, and this is no exception. A wonderful introduction to recent work on Paul and the so-called \"New Perspective on Paul.\"\n\n*History of Science*\n\n1. *The Pasteurization of France* by Bruno Latour: I think Latour does a good job at showing the social and cultural prerequisites necessary to encourage the French to accept Pasteur's microbes as revealed truth, as well as the process by which these conditions are obscured in favor of the \"Great Man\" thesis.\n\n2.  *A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England* by Steve Shapin: Shapin deftly argues that the practice of science in seventeenth-century England relied heavily on the reliable word of \"experts\" in a particular field, as experiments were expensive and laborious to reproduce. Trust emerges as a critical element in the production of scientific knowledge, and Shapin demonstrates that what we assume to be objective in science often rests on this foundation of trust in the scientist (as it does in every academic field).\n\n3. *Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism* by Mario Biagioli: Biagioli shows how crucial the patron/client relationship was for scientists in early modern Europe - particularly for Galileo and his principal patron, Pope Urban VIII. Again, this is another work that unpacks the social networks that undergird(ed) scientific study.\n\n4. *Objectivity* by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison: The book traces a critical problem of representation in the Scientific Revolution, particularly relating to representing objects of scientific study in atlases. For example: when making an entry for oak trees in a botany book, what kind of picture should one include? No two oak trees will look the same (though they will look similar), so how does the artist draw it so that it can be easily recognized in real life by referencing the atlas? How do you draw something like cloud formations in an atlas to demonstrate the difference between Cirrus and Cumulus clouds, even though clouds are constantly changing shape? Daston and Galison do a great job explaining the context of these debates and anxieties and what they reveal about the practice of science.","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"timi4","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Tiako","num_comments":210,"score":305,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","edited":1369697436,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":"archaeology","downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskHistorians/comments/timi4/the_askhistorians_master_book_list/","name":"t3_timi4","created":1336768441,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/timi4/the_askhistorians_master_book_list/","author_flair_text":"Roman Archaeology","title":"The AskHistorians Master Book List","created_utc":1336764841,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":305},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_timi4","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_timi4","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_timi4","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_timi4","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_timi4","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_timi4","likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"c5dtkxr","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"durpdurpdurpdurpdurp","parent_id":"t1_c4na0wc","score":9,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"You wouldn't share a book.","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&amp;#39;t share a book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","subreddit":"AskHistorians","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_c5dtkxr","created":1342245471,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":1342241871,"distinguished":null,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"ups":9}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"c4na0wc","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"blue_strat","parent_id":"t1_c4n7ue4","score":15,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; Plus, when you're done, you can share it with others.\n\nNo no!

Hope you guys enjoy, and let me know what you think ^u^\n\n**Alphabet:**\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v x y z ë ö ü é\n\nPronunciation of letters similar to the Deutsch alphabet. Umlauted letters pronounced like their non-umlauted counterparts except with an added short \"u/oo\" (like in the word \"moo\"). E.g \"ë\" is pronounced \"e+u\", and \"ü\" is simply an exaggerated \"u\" sound. the letter \"é\" is pronounced like the letter \"e\" (ā in english) except emphasized and sometimes inflected up. I should note that Umlauted letters are not pronounced gutturally like Deutsch though. Common in phrases, but may or may not be pronounced due to regional dialect variance or mood; \"é\" is also used to turn verbs into commands.\n\n**Verb Forms:**\n\n(Sin).

My wife and I both have full time jobs, behave like responsible adults, and do not have any lavish or expensive hobbies or habits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister in law is in her 5th year of school pursuing her 2 year degree, she has one year left. She originally moved in with us because she broke up with her boyfriend who she was living with at the time. This was a verbal 2 year deal, where she lives with us and pays us $300 a month rent and does not pay for utilities. When she first moved in, she worked in an office related to her field of study and was making good money. When school started in the fall, her office was not able to work with her school schedule, so she had to find another job. She has always lived a party-girl / diva lifestyle, so working as a bartender on campus was a logical choice for her, she could make $200-$300 a weekend no problem. So that is what she did (The bar she worked at let her drink on the job too!!!) This worked out fine for a while, but during the winter months, she wasn&amp;#39;t making as much money at the campus bar as she did during football season, so she decided to get a job working at a bar downtown. This did not work out well for her, because the owners ran the bar like an actual business and did not let their employees drink while the worked, or drink for free when they were off. This went on until she started a long distance relationship with a boy back in her hometown (about 3 hours away), let&amp;#39;s call him a money-bag enabler. He decided to take her to Vegas during spring break, which is fine. But now, she wants to go home every weekend to see him, and the bar downtown requires that you work at least one night per weekend during the late spring and summer. So when she was scheduled to work over memorial day, she had a meltdown with her supervisor crying on the phone, about how she never gets to spend any time with her friends or family, etc. So she finds another office to work in that is in her field of study that will work with her school schedule and give her 20 hours a week. So she puts in her notice at the bar and accepts the job at the office, but says that she cannot start for another 2 weeks, because she&amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; another vacation before summer quarter, so she goes home again for 10 days and doesn&amp;#39;t work. So, now she gets back and starts the job at the office, and it turns out they can only give her 10-15 hour a week instead of 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she comes to us and says that she needs to negotiate the $300 that she pays us for rent because she isn&amp;#39;t making as much as she was when she worked at the bar. We ask her what her expenses in a month are, and how much she thinks shell be making at the new job. She says that she doesn&amp;#39;t know. Its obvious to me that she has no idea how to budget. She then breaks down and says that school is so hard, and she has to take breaks every 3 months or shell just go crazy. She then says that she can move in with one of her friends for free, and that just send me over the edge, for me, it&amp;#39;s not about the money, it&amp;#39;s about respect and the responsibility.

I realize a lot of this depends on her personality, but I haven't seen her since she was 11 and it's a fair bet she's changed with the beginning of the teenage years...\n\nSorry if this is kind of hazy, I'd just really appreciate any advice you've got...Ugh...teenagers...","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"xnvtw","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"PsychoticTurkey","num_comments":19,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/xnvtw/reddit_my_sister_and_her_husband_just_came_by_to/","name":"t3_xnvtw","created":1344068482,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xnvtw/reddit_my_sister_and_her_husband_just_came_by_to/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Reddit, my sister and her husband just came by to drop off their 15 year-old daughter because they're going on vacation for a month and they don't want her home alone.

Pacing with no pattern, whiskey bottle in hand and still that ominous smile was scrawled over the bloodcurdling white face. Jeff was a mess, the voices louder, the anger hotter and the hatred even more horrific than thought imaginable. \n     It was blizzarding with snow out on that dark icy cold night. The clock struck  12 as a bead of sweat streamed down the white forehead of a man who shouldn&amp;#39;t be considered a man - more a monster. He sat down on an old, worn  box, put his leathery face in his palms and began shaking with a cold sweat. Rocking backwards and forwards. The muscular bare back, covered in scars and cigarette burns of a mad man shone in the moonlight. Laughter filled his head - Laughing and laughing - people mocking him with laughter, over and over and over again. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Trembling in his palms, his head flooded with the laughter until BAM he snapped, shot up like a bullet and hurled the empty booze bottle at the freezing concrete wall of his &amp;#39;habitat&amp;#39;. Then the whole warehouse went an eerie silence. The voices had stopped, Jeff had had enough of the insanity that had corrupted him stronger than ever that snowy night, and put on his white hoodie - he&amp;#39;d never leave without it - grabbed his trademark blade and stormed out the dented side door of the warehouse office; his &amp;#39;front door&amp;#39;. Closing it shut behind him firmly. Click.\n     Jeff was to himself, walking down the sidewalk with no cars or people whatsoever. It was like the apocalypse. The whole city was pitched black apart from the streetlights, the 10 or so 24-hour convenience stores dotted around the metropolis and the ultra-rare car. Nobody wanted to be out that night, it was bitter cold. The solitary sociopath walked down the barren streets at a snail&amp;#39;s pace. Hands in front pockets, knife attached to the belt of his black skinny jeans. The occasional scuff of his talon-toed shoes was the only sound that could be heard for miles bar the ferocious winds and the deep breaths from Jeff&amp;#39;s sadistic sliced open smile. \n     As Jeff lumbered on and looked into the large pane of one of the only restaurants open at that hour, a warm glow filled his black-ringed, scorched eye balls. There was a couple inside enjoying a romantic meal together: love. Jeff didn&amp;#39;t know of love, just hatred. Lou. Lou. Lou. With a brain full of distress and anguish, he turned his head slowly, and began trudging alone through the deep snow. \n    Still expelling no words, he continued his journey for about an hour, before coming across the city&amp;#39;s park. Stopping and glancing around he spotted the playground and advanced towards it without hesitation. Going through the gates there was an irritating screech of the rusted old metal. He scrapped his arm over the seat of the bench and carved himself a snow-less seating area. He sat down and stared into the fog that consumed the swings... the see-saw... the climbing frames... the boy who once was his brother Lou. Jeff&amp;#39;s body was momentarily riddled with adrenaline when he caught glance of the boys face, smiling. Out of no-where Jeff became smaller and stubbier, he could blink, there wasn&amp;#39;t the constant taste of dried blood around his freakish lips. The moon went down and the sun came up, it was spring time and there were children running all round having a blast. His mum was there. He was hallucinating of a time when Lou just came out of hospital after a harsh fever and Jeff&amp;#39;s mum treated the boys to a day at the park. \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;mon Jeff, let&amp;#39;s go to the sand pit and make a castle!&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Lou said in a high pitched childish voice. \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Sure, let&amp;#39;s go!&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff said with such young enthusiasm.\nToddling over to the sand pit with Lou, dodging other little boys and girls. When they reached their destination the 2 boys envisaged a huge castle with walls to protect its people, with soldiers and cavalry swarming the outer walls; and those boys were sure going to try and build it! \nAt that hope in their minds, a joyful tune could be heard in the distance getting closer and closer until an ice-cream van crawled around the corner of the surrounding vegetation. \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Jeffery! Louis! Do you boys wan&amp;#39; an ice cream?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff&amp;#39;s mother said with generosity.\nJeff quickly looked round with a large smile, \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Yes, mummy!&amp;#39;&amp;#39; he shouted and sprouted up like a beam of lightening, along with a happy Lou. Jeff was running on his young unstable feet when he tripped and landed hard on the bouncy ground of which playgrounds are made from. Almost resulting to tears he got back up and dusted himself off. Silence... No children, no birds, no nothing apart from a deep pitched hum that stuck right into his inner psyche; disturbing him greatly. He looked back up slowly towards the direction of the ice-cream truck, it was gone, everyone was gone. The sky went from a vibrant blue to a harsh grey, the clouds covered the sky, all the plants had withered, the trees were bare and dull and the foliage vanished. All signs of life were stripped from that once joyful park. Jeff ran, he ran as fast as he could but everything was in slow motion. He ran towards a distant phone box to phone for help - something his mum told him to remember as a child - but it just kept getting further and further. Jeff&amp;#39;s head was spinning, he felt dizzy, he felt sick. Suddenly, everything went fast, the days and nights lasted no more than a few seconds, and the ground beneath him started crumbling. The deep groaning sound was untainted during this ordeal.\n          Dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n     The yells of dying children in the distance was suddenly brought to his attention, it came from the local bowling greens. Jeff cantered towards it (surprisingly at normal pace). When the short, brown grass was in his view, he noticed a barrage of gravestones all over it with wilted plants on top of the graves. He approached the gate, as soon as he laid his hand on it, it transformed into ash and fell to the ground. All the stones were just generic tombstones and had the children&amp;#39;s names carved into them. 2  larger tombstones emerged from out of the ground in the centre, they were both angels holding a book in long robes - both covered in earth and vines. Jeff trotted towards them to find 2 open graves. One with the half rotted body of his mother and one with the mutilated body of Lou. Jeff&amp;#39;s body was riddled with adrenaline again and all of the skin of his young child&amp;#39;s body was covered in goose bumps. Jeff started crying into his palms and fell to the ground, and with that thud, snapped back into reality. He was back on the seat of the snowed over park, sprawled on the bench he has cleared to sit on and a squirt of dopamine excreted from his brain as he realised it was just a stubborn hallucination. Breathing a sigh of relief he leaned his head back.\n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Jeff&amp;#39;&amp;#39; whispered a boy right into his ear with a gust of breath.\nJeff shot up and turned around. Nothing was there; he ran. Out of the park and into the large 4 lane road, still blanketed with white. Chuff chuff chuff. Jeff breathed deeply as he sprinted without looking back at that god-forsaken place. Past the restaurant, which was closed by now, and down an alley where he stopped and rested up against the frozen brick wall that smelled like urine; recovering his breath. He looked up to the night sky, and the snow began again, laying gently on his white, leathery face.\n     Jeff regained his breathe, looked left and right  and sighed. He began the journey back to his &amp;#39;home&amp;#39;. Walking back, his head filled with the hallucination, he walked past the foot prints he had left there previously - only not as deep because the snow had filled them again. Walking with a quick pace, Jeff couldn&amp;#39;t get that image of Lou out of his head, it was a permanent image right in the forefront of his mind. About 40 minutes pass, the sociopath turns the corner of a bakery and down the mossy, graffitied  alley, through the broken, slimy fence and outside the warehouse, his &amp;#39;lawn&amp;#39;. He looked towards his front door... It was open? Jeff raised one eyebrow, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sure I locked that.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff was inquisitive. He walked towards the door, faster and half leaned over - still that one eyebrow raised. He put his head inside slowly, and scanned around. His &amp;#39;house&amp;#39; was a wreck, the furniture he had stolen was snapped and had their inside cotton poking out the various gashed down them. There was paper dotted around the floor, Jeff entered with a sense of confusion, though not fear. He knelt down and examined one of these mysterious pieces of paper. &amp;#39;The feral one watches&amp;#39; was jotted down in very untidy hand writing. Various cryptic doodles were sketched around the edges of the messy moist paper. Jeff raised his other eyebrow and dropped them both within a second and crumpled the paper in his cold hands before tossing it down and standing up.\n      He looked around all the walls surrounding him, finding nobody (or nothing). He then surveyed the ceiling. In the corner, was a face. A humanoid face, no nose, huge sinister mouth and shadowed out eyes. It just watched Jeff. It just watched. Jeff stared back at it, this thing did not make a sound, nor motion. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What do you want?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff shouted up at the mysterious creature. The only reply was the half dozen echoes of his question. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What are you?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Again the several echoes and not a single sign of life from the grotesque face. Jeff had had enough and picked up a brick that was on the warehouse ground. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Last chance.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff said with a higher pitch, like a mother to a disobedient child - with more of a taunting tone. After the expected silence he hurled the brick up and made a connection with the creatures face and it plummeted to the ground with a large crack. It then made an attempt to sit up, but it was unstable. When it regained stability it sat, back against the wall, kneeling. It was grey of colour, very thin and had spikes protruding from its spine. sharp claw-like hands, razor sharp. It shook its bloodied up head and then started staring at Jeff. Jeff smiled, he had caused damage to this creature and he craved more. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;mon, that&amp;#39;s it.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff said as he started walking slowly at the humanoid whilst unsheathing his trademark bowie knife. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s it.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff pounced at it, it dodged his attack with incredible speed and agility, and made for the door running on all fours, like an animal. Jeff looked over his shoulder with a maniacal smile, before running to the door. The snow had stopped. The creature was sprinting towards the hole in the broken slimy fence and dove through it with amazing agility. Jeff began sprinting also and tailed after it through the fence. Past the bakery and across the street. The creature left large, thin prints whilst Jeff left his usual talon-toed indents. Jeff&amp;#39;s blood coursing with adrenaline made running an ease as he took in deep, cold breaths and emitting a vast amount of condensation. He gave chase to the speedy alien-like creature for a solid 15 minutes before reaching a local gas station where the creature took hostel. It had smashed the bottom glass window of the door and entered. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve got you now.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff panted to himself and started walking aggressively to the station. Past the pumps, and crawled through the broken entrance. It was pitched black, Jeff hopped over the counter and snatched himself a Zippo. He opened it, the orange glow illuminating his white, bloodcurdling face in the midst of a dark shop. He looked around before hearing a large banging sound coming from the back door, where the cashiers would go for a smoking break. He walked over and opened the door, where he was met with a lot of gas containers all holding petrol. He put the Zippo in his pocket and proceeded outside to search again for his prey. Looking up he found the creature looking down on him from the roof, he put his knife in his mouth and climbed up, using the bins as an aid. Once Jeff was at the top, he was met with the creature at the opposite corner of the roof. He stood in the other, with a grin. The grin didn&amp;#39;t last long before he approached the animal. It jumped and pounced on him like a cheetah, he was on his back, the creature on top, pinning him down. It was screaming a roughened yell straight into his face, the blood from its injury earlier now dripping down onto Jeff&amp;#39;s face. He tried and tried, he could not untrap himself from under the humanoids weight. It kept screaming in his face. Jeff built up strength in his legs and forced the creature off him with enough force to push it up in the air for a short time. It rolled off the edge, scrapping the guttering as it plummeted once again due to Jeff&amp;#39;s actions. It punctured a gas container and petrol leaked everywhere, covering the creature - it was obviously injured as it was squirming and screaming. Jeff stood up and looked over the edge watching the blood mix with the petrol and laughed. The humanoid was not able to stand up, only cover itself in the flammable liquid of the puddle it was stuck, screaming in. It stopped screaming and thrashing and lay back, breathing very deeply and staring into Jeff&amp;#39;s scorched eyes; into his soul. Jeff soaked up all the feeling inside, the happiness of seeing this creature suffering. He pulled the Zippo from his pocket, ignited it... and through it at the creature. The huge burst of flames immediately engulfed the animal as it started thrashing and screaming with much more pain that before. Jeff stood and lavished in the scene before him, the orange tints of the flames reflecting on his eyeballs. The other cans combusted as they made contact with the naked flame and only tortured the humanoid even more. It only took 3 minutes of the inferno before the animal stopped screaming and died. Jeff didn&amp;#39;t take his eyes off the blaze, until he heard a siren coming in the distance. A local resident must have heard or seen what had happened from their houses and alerted the fire brigade. Jeff turned and ran quickly, jumping off the gas station and into some nearby shrubbery to remain undetected. That&amp;#39;s when he watched the fire engine pull in and deploy kitted up men and whispered to himself &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Go... To... Sleep...&amp;#39;&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Jeff was pacing around in the abandoned warehouse he called home. Pacing with no pattern, whiskey bottle in hand and still that ominous smile was scrawled over the bloodcurdling white face. Jeff was a mess, the voices louder, the anger hotter and the hatred even more horrific than thought imaginable. \n     It was blizzarding with snow out on that dark icy cold night. The clock struck  12 as a bead of sweat streamed down the white forehead of a man who shouldn't be considered a man - more a monster. He sat down on an old, worn  box, put his leathery face in his palms and began shaking with a cold sweat. Rocking backwards and forwards. The muscular bare back, covered in scars and cigarette burns of a mad man shone in the moonlight. Laughter filled his head - Laughing and laughing - people mocking him with laughter, over and over and over again. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Trembling in his palms, his head flooded with the laughter until BAM he snapped, shot up like a bullet and hurled the empty booze bottle at the freezing concrete wall of his 'habitat'. Then the whole warehouse went an eerie silence. The voices had stopped, Jeff had had enough of the insanity that had corrupted him stronger than ever that snowy night, and put on his white hoodie - he'd never leave without it - grabbed his trademark blade and stormed out the dented side door of the warehouse office; his 'front door'. Closing it shut behind him firmly. Click.\n     Jeff was to himself, walking down the sidewalk with no cars or people whatsoever. It was like the apocalypse. The whole city was pitched black apart from the streetlights, the 10 or so 24-hour convenience stores dotted around the metropolis and the ultra-rare car. Nobody wanted to be out that night, it was bitter cold. The solitary sociopath walked down the barren streets at a snail's pace. Hands in front pockets, knife attached to the belt of his black skinny jeans. The occasional scuff of his talon-toed shoes was the only sound that could be heard for miles bar the ferocious winds and the deep breaths from Jeff's sadistic sliced open smile. \n     As Jeff lumbered on and looked into the large pane of one of the only restaurants open at that hour, a warm glow filled his black-ringed, scorched eye balls. There was a couple inside enjoying a romantic meal together: love. Jeff didn't know of love, just hatred. Lou. Lou. Lou. With a brain full of distress and anguish, he turned his head slowly, and began trudging alone through the deep snow. \n    Still expelling no words, he continued his journey for about an hour, before coming across the city's park. Stopping and glancing around he spotted the playground and advanced towards it without hesitation. Going through the gates there was an irritating screech of the rusted old metal. He scrapped his arm over the seat of the bench and carved himself a snow-less seating area. He sat down and stared into the fog that consumed the swings... the see-saw... the climbing frames... the boy who once was his brother Lou. Jeff's body was momentarily riddled with adrenaline when he caught glance of the boys face, smiling. Out of no-where Jeff became smaller and stubbier, he could blink, there wasn't the constant taste of dried blood around his freakish lips. The moon went down and the sun came up, it was spring time and there were children running all round having a blast. His mum was there. He was hallucinating of a time when Lou just came out of hospital after a harsh fever and Jeff's mum treated the boys to a day at the park. \n''C'mon Jeff, let's go to the sand pit and make a castle!'' Lou said in a high pitched childish voice. \n''Sure, let's go!'' Jeff said with such young enthusiasm.\nToddling over to the sand pit with Lou, dodging other little boys and girls. When they reached their destination the 2 boys envisaged a huge castle with walls to protect its people, with soldiers and cavalry swarming the outer walls; and those boys were sure going to try and build it! \nAt that hope in their minds, a joyful tune could be heard in the distance getting closer and closer until an ice-cream van crawled around the corner of the surrounding vegetation. \n''Jeffery! Louis! Do you boys wan' an ice cream?'' Jeff's mother said with generosity.\nJeff quickly looked round with a large smile, \n''Yes, mummy!'' he shouted and sprouted up like a beam of lightening, along with a happy Lou. Jeff was running on his young unstable feet when he tripped and landed hard on the bouncy ground of which playgrounds are made from. Almost resulting to tears he got back up and dusted himself off. Silence... No children, no birds, no nothing apart from a deep pitched hum that stuck right into his inner psyche; disturbing him greatly. He looked back up slowly towards the direction of the ice-cream truck, it was gone, everyone was gone. The sky went from a vibrant blue to a harsh grey, the clouds covered the sky, all the plants had withered, the trees were bare and dull and the foliage vanished. All signs of life were stripped from that once joyful park. Jeff ran, he ran as fast as he could but everything was in slow motion. He ran towards a distant phone box to phone for help - something his mum told him to remember as a child - but it just kept getting further and further. Jeff's head was spinning, he felt dizzy, he felt sick. Suddenly, everything went fast, the days and nights lasted no more than a few seconds, and the ground beneath him started crumbling. The deep groaning sound was untainted during this ordeal.\n          Dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n     The yells of dying children in the distance was suddenly brought to his attention, it came from the local bowling greens. Jeff cantered towards it (surprisingly at normal pace). When the short, brown grass was in his view, he noticed a barrage of gravestones all over it with wilted plants on top of the graves. He approached the gate, as soon as he laid his hand on it, it transformed into ash and fell to the ground. All the stones were just generic tombstones and had the children's names carved into them. 2  larger tombstones emerged from out of the ground in the centre, they were both angels holding a book in long robes - both covered in earth and vines. Jeff trotted towards them to find 2 open graves. One with the half rotted body of his mother and one with the mutilated body of Lou. Jeff's body was riddled with adrenaline again and all of the skin of his young child's body was covered in goose bumps. Jeff started crying into his palms and fell to the ground, and with that thud, snapped back into reality. He was back on the seat of the snowed over park, sprawled on the bench he has cleared to sit on and a squirt of dopamine excreted from his brain as he realised it was just a stubborn hallucination. Breathing a sigh of relief he leaned his head back.\n''Jeff'' whispered a boy right into his ear with a gust of breath.\nJeff shot up and turned around. Nothing was there; he ran. Out of the park and into the large 4 lane road, still blanketed with white. Chuff chuff chuff. Jeff breathed deeply as he sprinted without looking back at that god-forsaken place. Past the restaurant, which was closed by now, and down an alley where he stopped and rested up against the frozen brick wall that smelled like urine; recovering his breath. He looked up to the night sky, and the snow began again, laying gently on his white, leathery face.\n     Jeff regained his breathe, looked left and right  and sighed. He began the journey back to his 'home'. Walking back, his head filled with the hallucination, he walked past the foot prints he had left there previously - only not as deep because the snow had filled them again. Walking with a quick pace, Jeff couldn't get that image of Lou out of his head, it was a permanent image right in the forefront of his mind. About 40 minutes pass, the sociopath turns the corner of a bakery and down the mossy, graffitied  alley, through the broken, slimy fence and outside the warehouse, his 'lawn'. He looked towards his front door... It was open? Jeff raised one eyebrow, ''I'm sure I locked that.'' Jeff was inquisitive. He walked towards the door, faster and half leaned over - still that one eyebrow raised. He put his head inside slowly, and scanned around. His 'house' was a wreck, the furniture he had stolen was snapped and had their inside cotton poking out the various gashed down them. There was paper dotted around the floor, Jeff entered with a sense of confusion, though not fear. He knelt down and examined one of these mysterious pieces of paper. 'The feral one watches' was jotted down in very untidy hand writing. Various cryptic doodles were sketched around the edges of the messy moist paper. Jeff raised his other eyebrow and dropped them both within a second and crumpled the paper in his cold hands before tossing it down and standing up.\n      He looked around all the walls surrounding him, finding nobody (or nothing). He then surveyed the ceiling. In the corner, was a face. A humanoid face, no nose, huge sinister mouth and shadowed out eyes. It just watched Jeff. It just watched. Jeff stared back at it, this thing did not make a sound, nor motion. ''What do you want?'' Jeff shouted up at the mysterious creature. The only reply was the half dozen echoes of his question. ''What are you?'' Again the several echoes and not a single sign of life from the grotesque face. Jeff had had enough and picked up a brick that was on the warehouse ground. ''Last chance.'' Jeff said with a higher pitch, like a mother to a disobedient child - with more of a taunting tone. After the expected silence he hurled the brick up and made a connection with the creatures face and it plummeted to the ground with a large crack. It then made an attempt to sit up, but it was unstable. When it regained stability it sat, back against the wall, kneeling. It was grey of colour, very thin and had spikes protruding from its spine. sharp claw-like hands, razor sharp. It shook its bloodied up head and then started staring at Jeff.

Pacing with no pattern, whiskey bottle in hand and still that ominous smile was scrawled over the bloodcurdling white face. Jeff was a mess, the voices louder, the anger hotter and the hatred even more horrific than thought imaginable. \n     It was blizzarding with snow out on that dark icy cold night. The clock struck  12 as a bead of sweat streamed down the white forehead of a man who shouldn&amp;#39;t be considered a man - more a monster. He sat down on an old, worn  box, put his leathery face in his palms and began shaking with a cold sweat. Rocking backwards and forwards. The muscular bare back, covered in scars and cigarette burns of a mad man shone in the moonlight. Laughter filled his head - Laughing and laughing - people mocking him with laughter, over and over and over again. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Trembling in his palms, his head flooded with the laughter until BAM he snapped, shot up like a bullet and hurled the empty booze bottle at the freezing concrete wall of his &amp;#39;habitat&amp;#39;. Then the whole warehouse went an eerie silence. The voices had stopped, Jeff had had enough of the insanity that had corrupted him stronger than ever that snowy night, and put on his white hoodie - he&amp;#39;d never leave without it - grabbed his trademark blade and stormed out the dented side door of the warehouse office; his &amp;#39;front door&amp;#39;. Closing it shut behind him firmly. Click.\n     Jeff was to himself, walking down the sidewalk with no cars or people whatsoever. It was like the apocalypse. The whole city was pitched black apart from the streetlights, the 10 or so 24-hour convenience stores dotted around the metropolis and the ultra-rare car. Nobody wanted to be out that night, it was bitter cold. The solitary sociopath walked down the barren streets at a snail&amp;#39;s pace. Hands in front pockets, knife attached to the belt of his black skinny jeans. The occasional scuff of his talon-toed shoes was the only sound that could be heard for miles bar the ferocious winds and the deep breaths from Jeff&amp;#39;s sadistic sliced open smile. \n     As Jeff lumbered on and looked into the large pane of one of the only restaurants open at that hour, a warm glow filled his black-ringed, scorched eye balls. There was a couple inside enjoying a romantic meal together: love. Jeff didn&amp;#39;t know of love, just hatred. Lou. Lou. Lou. With a brain full of distress and anguish, he turned his head slowly, and began trudging alone through the deep snow. \n    Still expelling no words, he continued his journey for about an hour, before coming across the city&amp;#39;s park. Stopping and glancing around he spotted the playground and advanced towards it without hesitation. Going through the gates there was an irritating screech of the rusted old metal. He scrapped his arm over the seat of the bench and carved himself a snow-less seating area. He sat down and stared into the fog that consumed the swings... the see-saw... the climbing frames... the boy who once was his brother Lou. Jeff&amp;#39;s body was momentarily riddled with adrenaline when he caught glance of the boys face, smiling. Out of no-where Jeff became smaller and stubbier, he could blink, there wasn&amp;#39;t the constant taste of dried blood around his freakish lips. The moon went down and the sun came up, it was spring time and there were children running all round having a blast. His mum was there. He was hallucinating of a time when Lou just came out of hospital after a harsh fever and Jeff&amp;#39;s mum treated the boys to a day at the park. \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;mon Jeff, let&amp;#39;s go to the sand pit and make a castle!&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Lou said in a high pitched childish voice. \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Sure, let&amp;#39;s go!&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff said with such young enthusiasm.\nToddling over to the sand pit with Lou, dodging other little boys and girls. When they reached their destination the 2 boys envisaged a huge castle with walls to protect its people, with soldiers and cavalry swarming the outer walls; and those boys were sure going to try and build it! \nAt that hope in their minds, a joyful tune could be heard in the distance getting closer and closer until an ice-cream van crawled around the corner of the surrounding vegetation. \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Jeffery! Louis! Do you boys wan&amp;#39; an ice cream?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff&amp;#39;s mother said with generosity.\nJeff quickly looked round with a large smile, \n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Yes, mummy!&amp;#39;&amp;#39; he shouted and sprouted up like a beam of lightening, along with a happy Lou. Jeff was running on his young unstable feet when he tripped and landed hard on the bouncy ground of which playgrounds are made from. Almost resulting to tears he got back up and dusted himself off. Silence... No children, no birds, no nothing apart from a deep pitched hum that stuck right into his inner psyche; disturbing him greatly. He looked back up slowly towards the direction of the ice-cream truck, it was gone, everyone was gone. The sky went from a vibrant blue to a harsh grey, the clouds covered the sky, all the plants had withered, the trees were bare and dull and the foliage vanished. All signs of life were stripped from that once joyful park. Jeff ran, he ran as fast as he could but everything was in slow motion. He ran towards a distant phone box to phone for help - something his mum told him to remember as a child - but it just kept getting further and further. Jeff&amp;#39;s head was spinning, he felt dizzy, he felt sick. Suddenly, everything went fast, the days and nights lasted no more than a few seconds, and the ground beneath him started crumbling. The deep groaning sound was untainted during this ordeal.\n          Dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n     The yells of dying children in the distance was suddenly brought to his attention, it came from the local bowling greens. Jeff cantered towards it (surprisingly at normal pace). When the short, brown grass was in his view, he noticed a barrage of gravestones all over it with wilted plants on top of the graves. He approached the gate, as soon as he laid his hand on it, it transformed into ash and fell to the ground. All the stones were just generic tombstones and had the children&amp;#39;s names carved into them. 2  larger tombstones emerged from out of the ground in the centre, they were both angels holding a book in long robes - both covered in earth and vines. Jeff trotted towards them to find 2 open graves. One with the half rotted body of his mother and one with the mutilated body of Lou. Jeff&amp;#39;s body was riddled with adrenaline again and all of the skin of his young child&amp;#39;s body was covered in goose bumps. Jeff started crying into his palms and fell to the ground, and with that thud, snapped back into reality. He was back on the seat of the snowed over park, sprawled on the bench he has cleared to sit on and a squirt of dopamine excreted from his brain as he realised it was just a stubborn hallucination. Breathing a sigh of relief he leaned his head back.\n&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Jeff&amp;#39;&amp;#39; whispered a boy right into his ear with a gust of breath.\nJeff shot up and turned around. Nothing was there; he ran. Out of the park and into the large 4 lane road, still blanketed with white. Chuff chuff chuff. Jeff breathed deeply as he sprinted without looking back at that god-forsaken place. Past the restaurant, which was closed by now, and down an alley where he stopped and rested up against the frozen brick wall that smelled like urine; recovering his breath. He looked up to the night sky, and the snow began again, laying gently on his white, leathery face.\n     Jeff regained his breathe, looked left and right  and sighed. He began the journey back to his &amp;#39;home&amp;#39;. Walking back, his head filled with the hallucination, he walked past the foot prints he had left there previously - only not as deep because the snow had filled them again. Walking with a quick pace, Jeff couldn&amp;#39;t get that image of Lou out of his head, it was a permanent image right in the forefront of his mind. About 40 minutes pass, the sociopath turns the corner of a bakery and down the mossy, graffitied  alley, through the broken, slimy fence and outside the warehouse, his &amp;#39;lawn&amp;#39;. He looked towards his front door... It was open? Jeff raised one eyebrow, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sure I locked that.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff was inquisitive. He walked towards the door, faster and half leaned over - still that one eyebrow raised. He put his head inside slowly, and scanned around. His &amp;#39;house&amp;#39; was a wreck, the furniture he had stolen was snapped and had their inside cotton poking out the various gashed down them. There was paper dotted around the floor, Jeff entered with a sense of confusion, though not fear. He knelt down and examined one of these mysterious pieces of paper. &amp;#39;The feral one watches&amp;#39; was jotted down in very untidy hand writing. Various cryptic doodles were sketched around the edges of the messy moist paper. Jeff raised his other eyebrow and dropped them both within a second and crumpled the paper in his cold hands before tossing it down and standing up.\n      He looked around all the walls surrounding him, finding nobody (or nothing). He then surveyed the ceiling. In the corner, was a face. A humanoid face, no nose, huge sinister mouth and shadowed out eyes. It just watched Jeff. It just watched. Jeff stared back at it, this thing did not make a sound, nor motion. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What do you want?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff shouted up at the mysterious creature. The only reply was the half dozen echoes of his question. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What are you?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Again the several echoes and not a single sign of life from the grotesque face. Jeff had had enough and picked up a brick that was on the warehouse ground. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Last chance.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff said with a higher pitch, like a mother to a disobedient child - with more of a taunting tone. After the expected silence he hurled the brick up and made a connection with the creatures face and it plummeted to the ground with a large crack. It then made an attempt to sit up, but it was unstable. When it regained stability it sat, back against the wall, kneeling. It was grey of colour, very thin and had spikes protruding from its spine. sharp claw-like hands, razor sharp. It shook its bloodied up head and then started staring at Jeff. Jeff smiled, he had caused damage to this creature and he craved more. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;mon, that&amp;#39;s it.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff said as he started walking slowly at the humanoid whilst unsheathing his trademark bowie knife. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s it.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff pounced at it, it dodged his attack with incredible speed and agility, and made for the door running on all fours, like an animal. Jeff looked over his shoulder with a maniacal smile, before running to the door. The snow had stopped. The creature was sprinting towards the hole in the broken slimy fence and dove through it with amazing agility. Jeff began sprinting also and tailed after it through the fence. Past the bakery and across the street. The creature left large, thin prints whilst Jeff left his usual talon-toed indents. Jeff&amp;#39;s blood coursing with adrenaline made running an ease as he took in deep, cold breaths and emitting a vast amount of condensation. He gave chase to the speedy alien-like creature for a solid 15 minutes before reaching a local gas station where the creature took hostel. It had smashed the bottom glass window of the door and entered. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve got you now.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Jeff panted to himself and started walking aggressively to the station. Past the pumps, and crawled through the broken entrance. It was pitched black, Jeff hopped over the counter and snatched himself a Zippo. He opened it, the orange glow illuminating his white, bloodcurdling face in the midst of a dark shop. He looked around before hearing a large banging sound coming from the back door, where the cashiers would go for a smoking break. He walked over and opened the door, where he was met with a lot of gas containers all holding petrol. He put the Zippo in his pocket and proceeded outside to search again for his prey. Looking up he found the creature looking down on him from the roof, he put his knife in his mouth and climbed up, using the bins as an aid. Once Jeff was at the top, he was met with the creature at the opposite corner of the roof. He stood in the other, with a grin. The grin didn&amp;#39;t last long before he approached the animal. It jumped and pounced on him like a cheetah, he was on his back, the creature on top, pinning him down. It was screaming a roughened yell straight into his face, the blood from its injury earlier now dripping down onto Jeff&amp;#39;s face. He tried and tried, he could not untrap himself from under the humanoids weight. It kept screaming in his face. Jeff built up strength in his legs and forced the creature off him with enough force to push it up in the air for a short time. It rolled off the edge, scrapping the guttering as it plummeted once again due to Jeff&amp;#39;s actions. It punctured a gas container and petrol leaked everywhere, covering the creature - it was obviously injured as it was squirming and screaming. Jeff stood up and looked over the edge watching the blood mix with the petrol and laughed. The humanoid was not able to stand up, only cover itself in the flammable liquid of the puddle it was stuck, screaming in. It stopped screaming and thrashing and lay back, breathing very deeply and staring into Jeff&amp;#39;s scorched eyes; into his soul. Jeff soaked up all the feeling inside, the happiness of seeing this creature suffering. He pulled the Zippo from his pocket, ignited it... and through it at the creature. The huge burst of flames immediately engulfed the animal as it started thrashing and screaming with much more pain that before. Jeff stood and lavished in the scene before him, the orange tints of the flames reflecting on his eyeballs. The other cans combusted as they made contact with the naked flame and only tortured the humanoid even more. It only took 3 minutes of the inferno before the animal stopped screaming and died. Jeff didn&amp;#39;t take his eyes off the blaze, until he heard a siren coming in the distance. A local resident must have heard or seen what had happened from their houses and alerted the fire brigade. Jeff turned and ran quickly, jumping off the gas station and into some nearby shrubbery to remain undetected. That&amp;#39;s when he watched the fire engine pull in and deploy kitted up men and whispered to himself &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Go... To... Sleep...&amp;#39;&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Jeff was pacing around in the abandoned warehouse he called home. Pacing with no pattern, whiskey bottle in hand and still that ominous smile was scrawled over the bloodcurdling white face. Jeff was a mess, the voices louder, the anger hotter and the hatred even more horrific than thought imaginable. \n     It was blizzarding with snow out on that dark icy cold night. The clock struck  12 as a bead of sweat streamed down the white forehead of a man who shouldn't be considered a man - more a monster. He sat down on an old, worn  box, put his leathery face in his palms and began shaking with a cold sweat. Rocking backwards and forwards. The muscular bare back, covered in scars and cigarette burns of a mad man shone in the moonlight. Laughter filled his head - Laughing and laughing - people mocking him with laughter, over and over and over again. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Trembling in his palms, his head flooded with the laughter until BAM he snapped, shot up like a bullet and hurled the empty booze bottle at the freezing concrete wall of his 'habitat'. Then the whole warehouse went an eerie silence. The voices had stopped, Jeff had had enough of the insanity that had corrupted him stronger than ever that snowy night, and put on his white hoodie - he'd never leave without it - grabbed his trademark blade and stormed out the dented side door of the warehouse office; his 'front door'. Closing it shut behind him firmly. Click.\n     Jeff was to himself, walking down the sidewalk with no cars or people whatsoever. It was like the apocalypse. The whole city was pitched black apart from the streetlights, the 10 or so 24-hour convenience stores dotted around the metropolis and the ultra-rare car. Nobody wanted to be out that night, it was bitter cold. The solitary sociopath walked down the barren streets at a snail's pace. Hands in front pockets, knife attached to the belt of his black skinny jeans. The occasional scuff of his talon-toed shoes was the only sound that could be heard for miles bar the ferocious winds and the deep breaths from Jeff's sadistic sliced open smile. \n     As Jeff lumbered on and looked into the large pane of one of the only restaurants open at that hour, a warm glow filled his black-ringed, scorched eye balls. There was a couple inside enjoying a romantic meal together: love. Jeff didn't know of love, just hatred. Lou. Lou. Lou. With a brain full of distress and anguish, he turned his head slowly, and began trudging alone through the deep snow. \n    Still expelling no words, he continued his journey for about an hour, before coming across the city's park. Stopping and glancing around he spotted the playground and advanced towards it without hesitation. Going through the gates there was an irritating screech of the rusted old metal. He scrapped his arm over the seat of the bench and carved himself a snow-less seating area. He sat down and stared into the fog that consumed the swings... the see-saw... the climbing frames... the boy who once was his brother Lou. Jeff's body was momentarily riddled with adrenaline when he caught glance of the boys face, smiling. Out of no-where Jeff became smaller and stubbier, he could blink, there wasn't the constant taste of dried blood around his freakish lips. The moon went down and the sun came up, it was spring time and there were children running all round having a blast. His mum was there. He was hallucinating of a time when Lou just came out of hospital after a harsh fever and Jeff's mum treated the boys to a day at the park. \n''C'mon Jeff, let's go to the sand pit and make a castle!'' Lou said in a high pitched childish voice. \n''Sure, let's go!'' Jeff said with such young enthusiasm.\nToddling over to the sand pit with Lou, dodging other little boys and girls. When they reached their destination the 2 boys envisaged a huge castle with walls to protect its people, with soldiers and cavalry swarming the outer walls; and those boys were sure going to try and build it! \nAt that hope in their minds, a joyful tune could be heard in the distance getting closer and closer until an ice-cream van crawled around the corner of the surrounding vegetation. \n''Jeffery! Louis! Do you boys wan' an ice cream?'' Jeff's mother said with generosity.\nJeff quickly looked round with a large smile, \n''Yes, mummy!'' he shouted and sprouted up like a beam of lightening, along with a happy Lou. Jeff was running on his young unstable feet when he tripped and landed hard on the bouncy ground of which playgrounds are made from. Almost resulting to tears he got back up and dusted himself off. Silence... No children, no birds, no nothing apart from a deep pitched hum that stuck right into his inner psyche; disturbing him greatly. He looked back up slowly towards the direction of the ice-cream truck, it was gone, everyone was gone. The sky went from a vibrant blue to a harsh grey, the clouds covered the sky, all the plants had withered, the trees were bare and dull and the foliage vanished. All signs of life were stripped from that once joyful park. Jeff ran, he ran as fast as he could but everything was in slow motion. He ran towards a distant phone box to phone for help - something his mum told him to remember as a child - but it just kept getting further and further. Jeff's head was spinning, he felt dizzy, he felt sick. Suddenly, everything went fast, the days and nights lasted no more than a few seconds, and the ground beneath him started crumbling. The deep groaning sound was untainted during this ordeal.\n          Dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n     The yells of dying children in the distance was suddenly brought to his attention, it came from the local bowling greens. Jeff cantered towards it (surprisingly at normal pace). When the short, brown grass was in his view, he noticed a barrage of gravestones all over it with wilted plants on top of the graves. He approached the gate, as soon as he laid his hand on it, it transformed into ash and fell to the ground. All the stones were just generic tombstones and had the children's names carved into them. 2  larger tombstones emerged from out of the ground in the centre, they were both angels holding a book in long robes - both covered in earth and vines. Jeff trotted towards them to find 2 open graves. One with the half rotted body of his mother and one with the mutilated body of Lou. Jeff's body was riddled with adrenaline again and all of the skin of his young child's body was covered in goose bumps. Jeff started crying into his palms and fell to the ground, and with that thud, snapped back into reality. He was back on the seat of the snowed over park, sprawled on the bench he has cleared to sit on and a squirt of dopamine excreted from his brain as he realised it was just a stubborn hallucination. Breathing a sigh of relief he leaned his head back.\n''Jeff'' whispered a boy right into his ear with a gust of breath.\nJeff shot up and turned around. Nothing was there; he ran. Out of the park and into the large 4 lane road, still blanketed with white. Chuff chuff chuff. Jeff breathed deeply as he sprinted without looking back at that god-forsaken place. Past the restaurant, which was closed by now, and down an alley where he stopped and rested up against the frozen brick wall that smelled like urine; recovering his breath. He looked up to the night sky, and the snow began again, laying gently on his white, leathery face.\n     Jeff regained his breathe, looked left and right  and sighed. He began the journey back to his 'home'. Walking back, his head filled with the hallucination, he walked past the foot prints he had left there previously - only not as deep because the snow had filled them again. Walking with a quick pace, Jeff couldn't get that image of Lou out of his head, it was a permanent image right in the forefront of his mind. About 40 minutes pass, the sociopath turns the corner of a bakery and down the mossy, graffitied  alley, through the broken, slimy fence and outside the warehouse, his 'lawn'. He looked towards his front door... It was open? Jeff raised one eyebrow, ''I'm sure I locked that.'' Jeff was inquisitive. He walked towards the door, faster and half leaned over - still that one eyebrow raised. He put his head inside slowly, and scanned around. His 'house' was a wreck, the furniture he had stolen was snapped and had their inside cotton poking out the various gashed down them. There was paper dotted around the floor, Jeff entered with a sense of confusion, though not fear. He knelt down and examined one of these mysterious pieces of paper. 'The feral one watches' was jotted down in very untidy hand writing. Various cryptic doodles were sketched around the edges of the messy moist paper. Jeff raised his other eyebrow and dropped them both within a second and crumpled the paper in his cold hands before tossing it down and standing up.\n      He looked around all the walls surrounding him, finding nobody (or nothing).

''What are you?'' Again the several echoes and not a single sign of life from the grotesque face. Jeff had had enough and picked up a brick that was on the warehouse ground. ''Last chance.'' Jeff said with a higher pitch, like a mother to a disobedient child - with more of a taunting tone. After the expected silence he hurled the brick up and made a connection with the creatures face and it plummeted to the ground with a large crack. It then made an attempt to sit up, but it was unstable. When it regained stability it sat, back against the wall, kneeling.

I have no idea what to do or where to turn.  I thought I would ask Reddit, since they seem to have gotten people through some tough times and been really great when it comes to advice.  It is a very long story, but here is basically what has happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 22.  I was born in Florida.  When I was 16 I moved to Connecticut with my folks.  I don&amp;#39;t really get along with my parents, but I wasn&amp;#39;t really getting anywhere in FL, so I thought CT would be a good opportunity for me.  I enrolled in a technical school there and lived with my parents for several years.  I slept on the couch most of the time, because once i finally got there, they told me they didn&amp;#39;t get a bedroom for me because, &amp;quot;we didn&amp;#39;t think you were coming&amp;quot;.  After 3 years of living with my parents, I dropped out of school and moved back to FL with my gf.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We lived there for 4 years, and we were happy.  But we had basically shuffled between shit kitchen jobs for minimum wage.  (The FL job market sucks. I was a drop out, but she had a culinary arts degree, and all she could find was work at Red Lobster.)  While I was gone, my relationship with my parents improved.  We talked on the phone every once and a while and we were cordial and friendly.  I had heard from other people that once they moved out of their parents house everything changed and their parents mellowed out.  I figured they were learning to see me as an adult. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, my parents approached me about a business opportunity.  They wanted to start a restaurant in CT.  While they had business experience, they had no restaurant experience, and that is where me and my gf came in.  We looked at it like a tremendous opportunity.  We were offered positions as managing partners.  We would help manage the restaurant and get a percent of the gross profits.  Sounded like a dream come true.  I was still weary of working for them, but I talked extensively about what the details of the arrangement.  They agreed to whatever I needed, and everything seemed to have been worked out.  So we quit out jobs that we hated, and packed our bags for CT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed fine at first, but slowly the things we were promised began to evaporate.  I sold my car to cover the moving expenses (at their advice) because they said we could have their truck that they didn&amp;#39;t want.  Once we got here tho, it was less &amp;quot;have my truck&amp;quot; and more &amp;quot;use my truck&amp;quot;.  We were told we would have active input on the menu, but then they said that the menu was what it was (which was shitty, for example they opened a BBQ restaurant and were completely opposed to serving any pork).  We were told we would be managers, but the first 3 months was just construction on the location, and they insisted on taking no part in the actually work (since my mom had another full time job and my day weighs almost 500 lbs), but just the decision making. When we would ask if we could be at least in  on the discussion we were told it wasn&amp;#39;t our place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Money became an issue as well.  We were working 5 days a week for 9 hours a day, and were being paid $60 a week (+being allowed to stay at there house).  When I would bring this up, we were told we were &amp;quot;actually&amp;quot; getting paid $10/hour, and that they had the numbers all worked out.  When i asked to see these numbers, it was always put off until later.  Now we are paid $100/week for 60 hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were frequent fights and shouting matches, my mother is a very unstable person.  My father has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (which I didn&amp;#39;t know about until I got here), but most of the time is simply too lazy to follow through on anything.  The fights were typically precipitated by us coming to them asking for them to make good on such-and-so promise.  They would escalate it into a fight until we simply dropped the issue all together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been going on for 5 months now.  The restaurant has been open for about a month, and not doing well.  We have taken in about $200 dollars in sales, and have been pitching a lot of food out all together.  Part of this is due to the fact that my mother insisted on doing what she called a &amp;quot;stealth open&amp;quot;.  No advertisement whatsoever, just a banner by the street.  The location itself has a huge billboard of  the old business still on the facade, so chances are no one has even noticed we are here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The slow business isn&amp;#39;t what I am upset about.  It&amp;#39;s the fact that they have become more and more aggressive as a result of it.  My mom lost her full-time job last week, and the stress of failure is clearly weighing down on them.  They fight with each other almost constantly, and they start fights with us whenever they can.  Things came to a head yesterday, when I told them I need money for gas to open the store.  It became a huge fight, which culminated with my father telling me &amp;quot;shut your fucking mouth!  Get in that fucking car!  And you open that fucking store on fucking time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that hind-sight is 20/20.  I know that reading this you would say I had it coming.  But I wanted to trust my parents.  I wanted to get out of my dead end situation in FL.  They outright lied through there teeth to get me here to work for them, and deliberately made me dependent on them for the things I need to live.  And now I am in a much worse situation than I ever was in FL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t deal with this anymore.  Living here is hell.  And the second I stop going to work, they have made it clear that they will evict us and take the car away.  The business is sinking, and they have made it clear also that they already have an escape plan that does not involve us.    There is no public transit where I am.  I have no other job, nowhere else to live, and even if I found a job I would have no way to get there and would be out on the streets anyway.  I spent my entire savings (not much) just getting up here and sold my most valuable possession (my car).

That guy is looking at my browsing history. Last august I looked at a picture of a Japanese post-op to see if they would say anything. Guess what the guy told me in September? That over the summer he had sex with a Japanese post-op. And the guys don&amp;#39;t wanna hang out with me anymore. It seems like they are always laughing at me. Pointing at me.

He walked around the block and when I saw him again I knew something was up. Anyways, I think her aunt is taking pictures through CCTV. They know I go to Milan, but I just listen to music in my car. They think I fuck trannies. Her aunt, she is a programmer, you know. She has access to stuff like that. All her colleagues are always talking about whores and joking about it with me. Why the hell would they do that? CAUSE THEY THINK I FUCK WHORES AND TRANNIES!!! That is why. And you know what her dad did?? Her dad asked if I wanted sausage the other night. Then he made a joke about anal sex. They think I fuck trannies, man. I know it.

I treated women with respect and as equals. I got rejected constantly by women. Throughout high school girls were very cruel. They laugh at me in the hallways. When I got older all I got was pitty. I&amp;#39;ve heard it all &amp;quot;oh, I just like you as a friend&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just not attracted to you&amp;quot;. This of course after spending hundreds of dollars and 4 weeks dating them, only to find out it wasn&amp;#39;t a date that we were &amp;quot;just friends&amp;quot;. After having my heart ripped out of my chest over and over for the last 14 years last year I had massive personality change. I started viewing all women as adult children, attention whores, liars, and whores in general. I got really angry. I&amp;#39;d walk down the street with just utter hatred in my eyes. Slowly that passed and I went numb. I can&amp;#39;t believe I feel this way, but I do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For many years, just to get by, I saw prostitutes. Frankly it was a life saver it kept me from wanting to kill myself. Well about two years ago the way I acted in bed changed, I went from be gentle... to well being very rough and violent. I found I loved the feeling it gave me controlling and dominating these women. I got really rough with them, basically rape if I&amp;#39;m honest.

Last night we went out and she bought all the drinks. Today I told her to clean my apartment, and she did. If she complains I tell I to GTFO and that I won&amp;#39;t be seeing her again. She begs for forgiveness. She started calling me &amp;quot;daddy&amp;quot; and I didn&amp;#39;t even ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start feeling proud about all this and then I get sick to my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I look at her and all I want to do is just punch the shit out of her. I think about seeing her bloody face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like shit. I hate how I am acting and I hate the way I feel but it&amp;#39;s the only way I can get a woman to notice me. Why the fuck are they like that?  I know the minute I start acting nice she&amp;#39;ll walk all over me. It&amp;#39;s happened a hundred times previously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blame women for this. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be this guy, they made me this way.

I treated women with respect and as equals. I got rejected constantly by women. Throughout high school girls were very cruel. They laugh at me in the hallways. When I got older all I got was pitty. I've heard it all \"oh, I just like you as a friend\" and \"I'm just not attracted to you\". This of course after spending hundreds of dollars and 4 weeks dating them, only to find out it wasn't a date that we were \"just friends\". After having my heart ripped out of my chest over and over for the last 14 years last year I had massive personality change. I started viewing all women as adult children, attention whores, liars, and whores in general. I got really angry. I'd walk down the street with just utter hatred in my eyes. Slowly that passed and I went numb. I can't believe I feel this way, but I do. \n\nFor many years, just to get by, I saw prostitutes. Frankly it was a life saver it kept me from wanting to kill myself. Well about two years ago the way I acted in bed changed, I went from be gentle... to well being very rough and violent. I found I loved the feeling it gave me controlling and dominating these women. I got really rough with them, basically rape if I'm honest. I'd shove my cock down their throats and just ram my cock up their asses. If they complained I said \"shut the fuck up. This is how I fuck.

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;X Faction Soldiers – Part 1\nI pace about anxiously, counting how many steps it takes to cross the width of the alleyway and back again, then folding that number over into how many times I’d made the crossing. So far, I’d taken 481 steps. This seemed like an unusual number of steps, considering it takes six paces to cross the alley, and twelve if you include the return journey. I must have taken an extra step or miscounted somewhere.\nCouldn’t have picked a worse place to meet. The alleyway is open at both ends; a narrow corridor which blasts cold air all over you and up your sleeves every time the wind blows. I tug the sleeves of my jacket impatiently; the leather tightens across my back slightly before relaxing again. I stop pacing, having lost count around the 490 mark. Fuck it. I glance briefly at my comrade as he toddles about casually, swaying from side to side in no particular direction, intermittently putting the bottle to his lips and gulping insatiably.\nThey should be here by now. I know we didn’t get the location wrong. Maybe Pyrus got it wrong, dozy fuck probably got the time and date wrong too. He never was much good at, well anything, but a job is a job, and this one sounds important. This is just what I need to get back into it.\nThe alleyway is littered with old bags of rubbish, many of them torn and split or flattened down by cars. I’d already finished reading my paper, The English Standard, and had cast it to the ground, stamping my heel on the image of the flag, grinding mud into it. Broken glass glistens along the edge of the walls, and the whole place stinks of stale piss. Underneath a layer of topsoil blackened by motor oil and tyre tracks, old cobbles protrude sparsely, revealing the original level of the street and betraying the age of the alley. Cobblestones; who knows when they were first lain. Could have seen three wars for all I know, could have seen four.\nI hold out my hand to my comrade and motion for him to hand the bottle to me. Greedy fucker will end up finishing it before I’ve had a swig otherwise. He hands the bottle to me reluctantly and eyes me enviously as I open my gullet and swallow as much as I can. As the initial sourness fades from my tongue, the alcohol hits my stomach, and an illusory internal warmth spreads upwards from my midriff to my oesophagus. I peer across at him, as he stares on expectantly. I close my eyes and choke back two more mouthfuls, which is more than I can usually hack in one go, but I force it down anyway to spite him, before handing it back. The sourness of the drink is quickly washed away by the feeling of thick saliva creeping up from my throat as my stomach churns in protest. I thrust my arm in his direction, handing the bottle back to him, and spit the excess saliva onto the ground. The warmth of the alcohol, and the mild nausea it brings, mellow together into a creamy release of queasiness and comfort. I close my eyes and exhale deeply relaxing my arms, welcoming the sharp wisps of cold air, savouring the bittersweet feeling.\nI once again survey the alleyway, inhospitable and ugly, the local councils invested a great deal of money into removing, blocking off or paving over areas such as this. The entire architecture of a conurbation could be chopped and changed, to remove any pockets of darkness, grime or obscurity. Modern dormitory towns were made up of cul-de-sacs, circling a central hub of grassland, so that each house could be seen from every other. The notion was that such architectural design would minimise criminal activity, and ensure the safety of the common man. In reality, the idea was to create an almost panoptic system of self-surveillance, coercing conformity and compliance, and minimising any recalcitrance amongst the working classes. Alleyways like this, though inhospitable and dead, were in essence a breeding ground for insubordination. In these grim and filthy pockets, obscured from prying eyes, men could truly exercise their intrinsic human right to independent thought, free assembly and affirmative action against the dominant ethos.\n“Got any fags?” I ask motioning with my finger.\n“Fuck off Pick, you’ve had shit-loads of mine” he protests\n“So fuck! You got any or what? I don’t go to war without a fag” I snap at him.\nI survey him as he reaches into the inside pocket of his waistcoat, pulls out a cigarette packet and throws them to me aggressively. I catch it, thumb one out and throw the pack back in his chest. He tries to catch the pack in vain, and then hunches down to pick it up off the ground. I snigger as he hunches over, gripping the grimy bowler hat on his head to stop it from falling off.\nMr Industry, or Indy to those who knew him, always wore a bowler hat, a loose tie, and a grubby frayed waist coat. It wasn’t really a waistcoat, at one point it had been the jacket of a luxurious Italian suit. He’d ripped the sleeves off some time ago, revealing the yellowing sleeves of a white polo shirt underneath, which he’d clumsily sown cuff links to. On the left sleeve he wore a Deadeye Totenkopf emblem, on the right, a twisted Ankh. He bulged out of his clothes- they were salvaged like mine-, and were at least two sizes too small.\nThe mock-formal wear ended at the top and the bottom of his person. His shoes were steel toe-capped leather work boots, though the leather had peeled and cracked at the toe, revealing the metal underneath. The bowler hat sat clumsily on a crown of short and spiky blood red hair, flecked sparsely with splashes of orange and purple. Stocky in stature, Indy was often mistaken for being flabby and out of shape, because although he was deceptively strong, more so than myself, his muscle lacked any definition whatsoever, giving him the appearance of being somewhat doughy.\n“Got a lighter Indy?” I ask, as he returns to an upright position, having retrieved his cigarette packet.\nHe looks at me apathetically.\n“You don’t even have a lighter?”\n“Aw fuck this!” I spit, “when are these faggots getting here?”\nIndy fumbles with the bottle and the cigarettes to find his lighter.\n“Shut up with your fucking whinging Pick, it takes as long as it takes, this isn’t a weekend break in the Cotswolds” he says mockingly.\n“It’s not a wank in a wind tunnel either. I’m not waiting all night”\nIndy hands me a lighter and I hastily light my cigarette, put it in my mouth and tug again at my sleeves. This jacket is too small, the sleeves run up and the wind runs up my arms, hitting my chest. The cold doesn’t bother me that much, I ‘m always cold. You live in squats for years on end and you learn to cope with it. It’s the waiting I can’t stand, makes me irritable. But I owe much of my success to my itchy feet and impatience. Ducks sit, crows fly and vultures pick the bones; that’s how me and Indy had stayed off the radar for so long.\nNowhere was safe for guys like us. X faction soldiers, Grimesters, Punk insurgents, Neo-anarchists, whatever the fuck they want to call us. For us, life is war, a constant perennial conflict. We remained separate, individual in action but collective in our ideology, a loose fraternity. X faction soldiers, the real ones I mean, lived in and out of slums and squats, remaining transient, uprooted and free. We travelled by night, hitched lifts, stole cars or rode the rails, and we never stayed in one place for too long. The first one to lay his head was the first one to lose it.\nI unzip my fly and let loose a stream of piss, aiming for the muddied flag of The English Standard. I watch as the urine soaks into the paper, and the colours fade into sepia.\nMuch was said about the ideology of the X faction, the media demonised us, the police and government hated us, and the general public feared us, but to say we followed an ideology was erroneous. It would be more fitting to describe us as anti-moral. We have little in the way of a prophetic vision of a world after the war is won, nor any plans to seize power or sanction any kind of great change. We are not politicians, nor philosophers. We simply detest the state of the nation, the draconian government which fosters it, and the indifferent apathetic majority who suffer it. To us the war is everywhere; to us the enemy is everyone. Anything we can do to break the party’s control, upset the balance of power, or disturb the established order is a victory. It doesn’t matter much what it was we do. Everyone in England, even those who refused to believe it, is being repressed and our civil liberties and human rights have been steadily eroded by the new government since the end of the fourth world war. Reckless abandon and wanton destruction, to me seems like the only action to further the cause of sanity, in a country swept up in a fever of madness. What else could I do to battle an authority that cultivated a culture of constant trespass upon the right to live in decency and dignity? What else could be spawned from such trespass but loathsome, undignified creatures such as ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I zip up my fly, watching the steam rise from the puddle, dissipating into the night air as the stream meanders around the cobblestones and broken glass.\nRebellion lay in the hearts of every man, but a man can spend his whole life keeping his head down, walking in step, and remaining compliant, knowing he is being exploited. It is only when he gets angry that he takes action, only after he’s seen the grotesque, fucked up face of our society for what it really is that he will make a stand. Destruction of any kind would unsettle the government and the people they control. It didn’t need to be aimed at anyone in particular. You could splash acid into the face of a police officer, burn a bank to the ground, or defecate in a public fountain. It didn’t matter. Every action that stirred up horror, misery or pain widened the area of sanity in which progress could be made, and fuelled the anger that would eventually culminate in the overthrow of our corrupt fascist leaders.\nOur emancipation from central leadership gives us the freedom to act autonomously, completely independent of command. There is no hierarchy to break, no ranks to infiltrate, no head honchos for the Big Boots to bag ‘n’ drag, no documents to burn, no stratagems to foil, no territory to invade, no castle with which to lay siege. The only victory anybody can hope for is to shut us down one individual cell at a time. That is how our movement survives. The individual may die or disappear, but the collective consciousness lives on.\nA gust of wind causes an ember to break away from the end of my cigarette, landing on the palm of my hand. I wince in pain momentarily as the ember dies. The sensation of searing flesh on my palm is an all too vivid memory, briefly reanimated by the ember.\nIndy looks across at me sympathetically. An uncommon sight from a man as wholly non-empathetic as he. I squint back at him bitterly, resentful of his pitying looks. The faction has time for camaraderie, and even to some degree compassion, but never sympathy. A true Grimester could hobble into a squat, sick, hungry or injured, and he would be taken care of to the best standard available, but no level of emotive compassion was wasted on one another. In part, this was to weed out the weak; those of soft heart who would rat out their comrades to the Big Boots if they got captured, but it wasn’t just that. The life of a Grimester meant that you could be sitting in a warehouse getting fucked up with your closest allies one minute, and be running for your life the next. Friends came and went, and it wasn’t just the transient lifestyle that precipitated it, people you knew personally could be literally dragged away with a bag over their head, and in an instant they were never seen again.\nThough we have nobody to answer to, our faction has a spiritual leader; an enigma of a man known as X. Much was spoken about X, but very little was actually known. He communicated entirely through a single soldier, Zero, whose mystery status was almost on a par with X himself. X was our inspiration. Ever since the Hostis Publicus Act was passed back in 2037, the ruling party has had free rein to arrest, interrogate and execute anybody deemed to be an enemy of the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;X was public enemy number one, closely followed by Zero, and a number of other notorious Grimesters. The list was based on notoriety and perceived threat to the domestic security of the nation. The top ranks were a veritable list of serial killers, master bomb makers, and Hacktivists. Further down the list were philosophers and intellectuals and former academics, who’d publicly shunned government legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much was said about X in the media. For a person whom nobody knew much about, people had no trouble attaching labels to him; Mass murderer, Lunatic, Schizophrenic, Psychotic, Rapist, Terrorist, Racist, Homophobe, Drug addict, Paedophile, Bank robber… The list was endless. All I knew about X was based on the accounts of other Punk insurgents, which were likely as flawed as tabloid reports themselves. For what I knew, he was an immensely powerful individual, both in his semantic aptitude, and his physical prowess. X was both feared and revered by both his enemies and his allies. His charisma was magnetic, and his command of language was palpable, a sabre-tongued overseer who could metaphorically whip a crowd into a frenzy in an instant, inciting infectious rioting amongst a localised population. Physically, he was believed to be immensely strong, and capable of withstanding colossal echelons of punishment. Rumour had it that he was often directly involved in the acts of destruction carried out by the insurgents, never shying away from a fight or a riot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hum of an engine approaches in the distance. My ears prick up. It is a petrol engine. That’s something. The police and the Big Boots, their vehicles are always diesel. There’s a slight but noticeable difference in the sound of the engine, knowing that is the difference between being bagged and dragged, or making a stealthy escape.\nA car pulls around the corner into the alleyway. The headlights are off. The thing is falling to bits. Either stolen or abandoned. It doesn’t matter. No vehicle is maintained, once they stop moving, we leave them where they stand.\nA man with a red Mohawk and a leather jacket not dissimilar to my own sits at the steering wheel. He locks eyes with me, grimaces, and climbs hastily out of the car, followed in turn by a young girl and another man of similar build to Indy. I glance at first at the man with the Mohawk, then at the man who is still in the car, and from his misshapen yellow teeth, I realise quickly that I know who he is. The girl is not familiar, but I eye her up from head to toe and supress a grin.\n“You here for the job?” The man with the red mohawk asks impatiently.\n“No” I spit, “we’re selling rainbow coloured unicorn spunk. You took your fucking time.”\n“And what? Stop fucking whining” He imprecates, turning to Indy, “What do they call you?”\n“Indy.” He nods, “Mr Industry for short”\n“And your friend?”\n“Pick. Short for Icepick.”\nHe turns to look at me, sniggering.\n“Icepick?” He laughs, “Look at him, all skin, bones and no bollocks.”\n“Fuck you” I scowl, “I’ll skin your bones if you carry on like that”\n“Settle down, Toothpick.” He mocks, “What you even doing on this job anyway? You look like a skinny faggot.”\n“Don’t worry about Pick” Indy interjects, “Pick can be a cold blooded fucker when he needs to be.” He nods reassuringly, “What do they call you?”.\n“I’m Brass.” He nods.\nI take a moment to examine Brass. He stands at about 6ft5, with a thick red Mohawk adding an extra foot to his height. His height is in proportion to the broadness of his shoulders, and although his jacket is made of thick cowhide, he clearly has a muscular physique. His face is clean shaven, or perhaps he does not grow much facial hair. The tops of a spider web tattoo can be seen encroaching on his neck, where a thick steel chain hangs loosely, tucked into his jacket. His right ear is adorned with an earring in the shape of a twisted Ankh and a Yin Yang twisted into the shape of an Infinity symbol. His hands seem to be permanently clenched into fists, and I can see that this is because he is wearing chrome-plated brass knuckles. His jeans are black and ripped at the knees, tucked into a pair of thick leather stomping boots, one of which has been bandaged with electrical tape. Lines form on his face, making him seem as if he is permanently snarling and frowning.\n“And this is Pogo” He says, pointing to his comrade whom I’d noticed earlier; a portly man with a snarling contorted face. I’d seen pictures of him in The English Standard and other newspapers. He was shorter than the papers made him look, despite this, no still photo or video clip could do him justice; his whole character exuded a palpable dread, so much that I struggle to focus on any one part of his face.  His lips twitch intermittently, revealing a set of jarred yellowing teeth. His eyes dart about rapidly as though he is constantly sniggering at something. His face is plastered in thick white make up, or maybe its paint. Around his eyes and lips, sharp shapes are painted in blue, with thick black outlines. His hair is bright blue and spikey, like a demonic jester. His clothes are baggy and striped vertically, splattered randomly with various colours, mainly blue and red. His hands are almost as white as his face, and his fingernails are long and sharp, as if they’ve been filed into talons.\nBrass points his thumb backwards towards the girl.\n“And she doesn’t go by any name.”\n“Yes I do” she snaps.\n“Yeah, but not one anybody cares about.” Brass sniggers.\nI look at the girl. She looks decidedly unamused. Her hair is black and jagged, that hangs in long limp strands in places, and is cut nearly down to the scalp in others. Her eyes are dark and heavy, her face smeared with roughly applied makeup, and bright red lipstick which is smeared around her mouth. Her clothes are predominantly black and lacy, frayed and ripped at the edges, a black leather strap hangs over her shoulder, attached to a small bag which hangs at her waist. She is petite, and holds a look of vulnerability about her, which I’m certain is put on deliberately.\n“You all know the plan?” Brass asks, addressing the group.\n“Yes” everybody murmurs in unison.\n“Well that’s fucking funny, because I haven’t even told you what it is yet.” Brass grunts, spitting on the ground.\n“Where are the others?” He grunts irately.\n“Others?” I ask, frustrated at the thought of having to wait for more people.\n“Yes, the others.” Brass spits, “There are three groups of us.”\n“Ah fuck waiting for them.” I groan.\n“We’re waiting, and you’re waiting with us.” He retorts, “We’ll need more muscle. Can’t go to war with a toothpick and a fat cunt can we?” He sniggers.\n“Hey! We’ve put the field time in, we’re more than capable of taking down a van.” Indy affirms.\n“Oh, so you must be the brains of the outfit eh?” Brass responds poking Indy in his forehead sharply. He turns to me.\n“And fuck me, I guess that make you the beauty, doesn’t it Ice Prick?”\nPogo lets out a cackle, as the girl rolls her eyes and looks away impatiently.\nI raise my eyebrows and fix him with a pitying stare.\n“Your woman looks embarrassed.” I nod towards the girl.\n“What’s the matter sweetheart? Not getting enough of the good stuff from handsome over here?” I say, tapping Brass on the chest.\n“Get fucked.” She spits at me, “Scrawny faggot, you don’t look like you could fuck your way out of a paper bag.”\n“That’s fine, you look like you’ve sucked your way all the way down the soup line at the city mission many times.” I snigger.\n“Handbags away ladies, can we focus on the task at hand, please?” Indy interjects.\n“And what task is that, Indy?” I ask , “Right now, all we’re doing is waiting on yet another group of punks, who are probably too busy dry-wanking themselves to sleep in a warehouse somewhere to have even made the effort to turn up.”\n“Actually” A voice comes from above, “I’ve been waiting longer than you have”.\nI look up to see a stocky African man with a shaved head standing on the roof of the alleyway above us.\n“What the fuck?” Indy says in shock.\n“Somebody had to keep a look out.” He says smugly, “It seems that you guys were too busy measuring dicks to keep focussed.”\nThe man jumps dangles from the edge of the roof, then drops to the floor among us.\nHe is tall and reasonably muscular, wearing little more than a black denim jacket a plain black shirt and jeans. His image is less than distressing, as would be expected from a Grimester. With no visible tattoos, piercings or attire, he could have passed for a civilian.\n“You the boy?” Brass asks irate.\n“I’m the man.” He winks, “Prince Randian. And you are Brass, Pogo, Mr Industry and Icepick.” He responds, highlighting our failure to sweep the area for prying eyes.\n“Your name I didn’t catch.” He says, pointing to the girl.\n“That’s Sadie.” Brass says, “Sadie by name, sadistic bitch by nature.”\nSadie smiles wickedly.\n“You can come out now” Randian shouts.\nA man appears from around the corner of the back alley. I look him up and down, and dismiss him immediately as a comrade. He is a dejected, apathetic man. His hair is long and scraggly and his clothes baggy and plain. His mouth hangs open slightly and his arms swing low by his side.\n“Who the fuck is this?” I turn to Randian.\n“This is Brain”\n“Brain-fucking-dead if you ask me.” Brass adds. I chuckle softly at Brass’ comment and our eyes meet briefly, our mutual dislike of Brain becoming our temporary common ground.\nBrain continues to stare vacantly, as though unaware he is being ridiculed.\n“Right”, Brass says stepping forwards, asserting leadership, “If that’s all of us, let’s get a campfire meeting underway, we’re already short on time.”\nAh, the campfire meeting. The ritualistic smoking of Menstrual Minstrel, or some other cannabinoid, followed by the talking of shit. Theories differed on why we did this; some related it to the actions of the Hashshashins in 11th century Syria, who would smoke Hashish after committing murders. Personally, I think that story is bollocks, made up by posers trying to make their recreational drug use seem profound and deep. I think it’s done to root out undercover spies. A true X insurgent comes into regular contact with drugs, and won’t lose their head. A police officer gets piss tested every week, and the Big Boots can’t even drink, but most importantly, when you’re under the influence of Minstrel, the memories you have are so vivid, it feels as though you’re reliving every second of it in real time. It can be seen on your face, in your eyes, and in your voice. An undercover spy couldn’t put on that kind of performance.\nBrass pulls a joint out from his jacket pocket.\n“Who wants to go first?” He says, brandishing it about like a dagger.\n“Fuck that Brass” Indy snaps, “Why’d you pre-roll? I don’t trust it. Roll one right here, right now.”\n“I did it to save time.” He snaps.\n“You were the ones who were late, we got here on time. Roll a new one.”\nBrass reaches into his pocket and throws a bag of Minstrel, along with various paraphernalia at Indy, who catches it clumsily.\n“You fucking roll it then, Mr Impotent.” He growls angrily.\nIndy opens the baggy a little, and sniffs it deeply.\n“What kind of Minstrel is this?” He asks.\n“It’s not Minstrel, it’s Lucipher’s Pubes.” Brass responds.\n“Ah, I don’t like pubes, kinda burns my throat.”\n“I don’t give a flying fuck about your throat, roll it up and smoke it, before I fuck you in the throat.”\nA few minutes pass in silence, whilst Indy layers tobacco and the red herbs together, and rolls it into a joint.\n“Roller’s rights I suppose, so I’ll go first.” Indy says holding the joint between his thumb and index finger.\n“Rock out with your cock out.” Brass responds vacantly.\nIndy puts the joint in his mouth, lights the end and inhales sharply. The effect can be felt immediately, no matter how much you smoke; part of the popularity of Rougecannabinoids are that the effects of tolerance are minimal.  Indy holds a lungful for about ten seconds before exhaling.\n“What do they call you and why?” Brass asks.\n“My name is Mr Industry” He replies in a hoarse voice, “I get my name because I burnt down a factory in Hammersmith, and because of my Captain of Industry attire.”\n“What did the factory produce?”\n“Automotive parts”\n“How did you do it?”\n“I used to work there when I was a civilian. I stayed back one night after work, hid in the changing rooms. Started the fire using petrol and oil soaked rags.”\nBrass raises one eyebrow, as if he suspects Indy might be lying.\n“What have you done lately?”\n“Smashed up a set of traffic lights at Piccadilly circus. Firebombed a lorry depot. Shaved off my pubes and mixed them into the coffee grounds at CoffeeGo.”\nPogo chuckles lightly at this.\n“What weapons do you use?”\n“Molotovs for destruction, knives and clubs for fighting, whatever I can get my hands on. Bottles, whatever.”\n“Why did you join the X Faction?”\n“Because the Industrial revolution created a war machine. Post-Industrial nations are stuck in a state of perpetual, unwinnable war, fuelled by the debt-driven rat race. The only way to free humanity from war and economic slavery is to break the whole system apart.”\n“Pass it on.” Brass nods, convinced Indy is legitimate.\nIndy hands the joint to Brain, who put it to his lips and draws hastily.\n“Name?” Brass asks curtly.\n“Brain” He replies softly.\n“Why do they call you Brain?”\n“Because my name is Brian, and it got spelt wrong.”\n“And you just told me your real name!” Brass shouts viciously, “What is wrong with you? Your mother drop a brick on your head?”\nBrain looks at the ground dejectedly.\n“Answer me!” Brass demands.\n“No she didn’t” He mutters submissively, “It got spelt wrong.”\n“What have you done for the X faction, Brain?”\n“I put a piranha in a public fountain once”\n“And what else?”\n“I shat in a golf ball cleaner at the country club and it got-“\n“-You’re not ready for this Brain. This is balls-to-the-brick, hammers in the air, ready to smash, you understand? No fucking about. This is the real shit. This is insurgency. You’ve got to have big brass balls, are you prepared?”\n“I think so”\n“Are you prepared!?” Brass snaps angrily.\n“Yeah, I’m prepared.” He responds with a little more fervour.\nBrass sighs wearily.\n“What weapons do you use?”\n“I’ve got a Luger from Germany.”\nThis sparks Brass’ interest.\n“You have a Luger?”\n“Yes, I got it converted in Hackney, from a replica, but now it fires real bullets.” Brain grins, “It’s one of those revolvey-type ones.”\n“Show it to me.” Brass demands.\nI step forward from the circle.\n“Luger’s don’t revolve, Brain-Bollocks” I shake my head in disappointment, “You own a revolver. The clue is in the name, fucktard.”\nBrass nods his head in agreement, before turning back to face Brain.\n“Where is your gun Brain?”\n“I left it at the squat.” He murmurs.\n“Oh fuck me…” Brass presses a hand to his face.\nAfter a moment, he asks the final question.\n“Why did you want to become an X faction soldier?”\n“It’s the only thing I’m good at doing.” He replies softly.\n“Right” Brass says, unimpressed, “Pass it on”.\nBrain looks around at the circle vacantly, passing the joint to Sadie.\n“What do they call you, and why?” Brass asks.\n“Some people call me Scalpel Sadie.”\n“-And why?” Brass reiterates.\n“Because I’m a fucking surgeon.” She giggles.\n“And what have you done for the insurgency?”\n“I hitch-hike. I wait for my white knight to pick me up from the side of the road. Then when he tries to collect his fare, I get surgical.”\n“What do you mean?” I ask intrigued.\n“Sometimes it’s just a little keyhole surgery, or maybe a circumcision, but some dogs need to be fully snipped, otherwise they’ll never learn to behave.”\n“You cut off men’s dicks?!” Indy blurts out in awe, before succumbing to a fit of giggles, “That’s fucked up!”\nBrass, evidently already aware of this, nods along unamused.\n“You hear that Brain?” I nudge him in the ribs, “You might get lucky, Sadie might drain your main vein!” I laugh.\nBrain shuffles away from me nervously.\n“Need we ask what weapons you use?” Brass grins.\nSadie slides two scalpels out from each sleeve of her jacket, stands in the centre of the circle, and twirls around playfully with her arms out at her sides and the joint in her mouth, before returning to her position.\n“Why did you join the X Faction, Sadie?” Brass asks impartially.\n“The world fucked me.” She laughs, “So I fuck it up.” She says, slashing forwards with the scalpel.\n“Pass it on.” Brass nods unflinching.\nNext in the circle is Pogo. I’d anticipated this since I saw him exit the car.\nPogo clutches the joint in his jagged teeth, and widens his eyes in anticipation.\n“What do they call you and why?” Brass says hastily.\n“They call me Pogo!” He beams in a voice that almost sounds bi-tonal, as if two people are talking at once, one tone is deep and gravelly, whilst the other is a shrill whistle.\n“The magical mystical musical clown, entertaining every town!” He chuckles.\nBrass hesitates a little, as if he is a little nervous about speaking with Pogo.\n“Right.” He says dropping his eyelids briefly, “And what have you done for the X Faction?”\nI step forward once again, unable to contain myself.\n“We all know what he’s done! He’s Pogo the fucking clown, the Jaded Jester.” I say, turning to face Pogo himself.\n“If the devil himself walked the streets of London, he’d run from this sick cunt!” I laugh in star-struck awe.\n“You killed Violet Tate-Jones” I say locking eyes with the clown.\n“She was  walking down the stairs, wearing lacy underwear, didn’t know of Pogo there. Oh she screams and how she stares! Scream the house down, no-one cares!”\nThe murder of Violet Tate-Jones had sparked a day of mourning in England. Every tabloid newspaper was filled with tributes to the one they called ‘Hollywood’s answer to Princess Diana’. Not only was she an A-List actress, but also fancied herself as a peace ambassador to the breakaway states of Eastern Europe and South East Asia, frequently visiting war zones to carry out humanitarian aid and deliver peace talks. One day at her home in London, she was violently murdered by an X faction grime punk, known to the police and papers as the Jaded Jester. To those of us who frequented the sub-cities, he was Pogo the clown, a notorious serial killer and cannibal. I’d always had a fascination with the darker side of the human psyche, and Pogo was about as fucked up as you could get.\n“How did she scream?” I ask, leaning my face towards Pogo.\nA wicked grin spreads across his face, cracking his white makeup.\n“Like a banshee.” He giggles.\n“I am a mechanical boy, I am my mother’s toy. Don’t do anything illegal, always beware of the eagle!” He sings menacingly.\nI furrow my brows and lean in towards him.\n“What does it mean?” I ask in a hushed tone, optimistically hoping for a deeper insight into the machinations of Pogo’s mind.\nBrass grips my shoulder and pulls me backwards.\n“I’m asking the questions!” He growls.\nI return to my place in the circle, as Brass steps into the centre once more.\n“What weapons do you use Pogo?”\nPogo withdraws a machete from his trouser leg and waves it around in the air haphazardly.\n“Pogo likes toys that make no noise.” He giggles, replacing the machete.\nBrass breathes deeply, relieved that Pogo had replaced his weapon.\n“Why did you join the insurgency?”\nPogo closes his eyes and sticks his tongue out.\n“For fun!”\n“Pass it on.”\nThe joint is passed to Prince Randian, who wipes the roach with his coat sleeve before placing it in his mouth and inhaling lightly.\n“What’s your name and why?”\n“Prince Randian.” He nods, “Ever seen a man roll a cigarette and light it using just his lips?”\nBrass squints at him, confused.\n“Randian can.” He nods.\n“Whatever.” Brass “What have you done for the cause?”\n“I hacked into the computers at the Bank of England, altered the software and produced GrimeNote” He says conceitedly.\nGrimeNote, considered by some to be the X Faction currency. In reality, it was little more than a novelty or an ornament, but it was used occasionally by Grimesters, not so much for trade, but more as tokens of appreciation for acts of camaraderie. The story hit the papers when a number of bank notes entered circulation with an image of the king’s head, decayed and burning, with a Deadeye Totenkopf carved into his forehead, and a twisted Ankh protruding from his head; the symbols of the insurgency. Much of the currency was seized and destroyed, but a lot of the notes were still circulating. The action lead to many grime punks defacing bank notes on mass to replicate the original GrimeNotes. I held a few original GrimeNotes myself, but it had always perplexed me as to how the notes had made it from the Royal Mint directly into the hands of the public without detection.\n“So you’re one of those neo-techno-cyber-anarchists or whatever” Sadie chides.\n“Primarily yes” Randian responds, “Economic terrorism can be just as, if not more effective, than shitting in golf ball cleaners or murdering innocent celebrities.”\nHe nods towards Brain and Pogo.\n“But if your concern is that I haven’t had time in the field, you won’t leave here in any doubt that I can fight.”\n“What weapons do you use?” Brass interjects, growing weary of Randian, “You’d better have brought more than a laptop.” He says, sniggering.\n“I use my hands and my feet.” He grins, “I don’t need a knife to make a man bleed.”\nThis level of brash arrogance irritates me.\n“Oh fuck off” I spit, “Tough as old boots are you?” I say, stepping forward and jabbing Randian in the chest.\n“Let’s see how hard you are when the Big Boots are stamping your face into a concrete floor.”\nRandian rolls his eyes mockingly.\n“I bet you can’t fight for shit.” I say raising a fist in the air.\n“Make me bleed, faggot.” I growl.\nBrass reaches his arm out, knocking me backwards.\n“He’s in.” Brass hisses, “I know who he is, and so should you.”\n“Yeah, I bet you do” I retort, “You know everybody, don’t you Brass?”\nBrass shrugs dismissively.\n“I get around.”\n“What makes you think you should be campfire leader anyway?” I ask cynically, “Half the people here are your buddies anyway, and Randian and the drugged up remedial? They were here before we even knew it. How do I know you aren’t all spies?” I say, waving my finger at them all.\n“I fucking dare you to say that again!” Sadie shouts.\n“Fuck you Sadie” I growl, “and that’s another thing Brass, who brings their girl along to a job like this?”\n“She isn’t my girl, we were just in the same squat.”\n“So maybe she’s bouncing on Pogo’s pogo-stick, whatever.”\n“Fuck that, are you serious!?” Sadie says outraged.\n“Reign it in Pick” Indy shouts, jabbing me in the chest firmly “They’re chicken soup, and you already knew Pogo anyway, you saw his picture in the papers.”\nI pick up the bottle from the ground and point it towards Randian. Indy steps in front of me shaking his head. I lower the bottle, breathe deeply, unscrew the lid and put it to my lips, swigging deeply.\nIndy had a point.\n“Yeah, give it a rest, Toothpick.” Brass growls, “You really think the Big Boots would go to this much effort just to bring you guys in?”\nI lower the bottle, and meet his gaze.\n“You aren’t exactly notorious.”\nMy face twitches a little, irate at Brass’ belittling comments.\n“And what makes you think we trust you two anyway?” He continues.\nI raise my hand, exposing the palm.\n“Look at my scar” I say, displaying it to the group.\nBrass looks at my burned palm keenly.\n“How’d you do that?” he asks inquisitively.\n“Big Boots raided a squat we had down in Brighton. I was sleeping.”\nBrass nods for me to continue.\n“I had my acky bomb, but I didn’t have my gloves.” I explain, “I got roughed up, grabbed my acky and smashed it over his face. Burned my hand.”\nBrass lets a wry smile cross his face.\n“Me and Indy escaped by jumping from a window. Turns out one of the punks was a spy, let the Boots in through the back door.”\n“Shit man” Brain says in awe, “that’s nasty”\n“No.” I say facing Brain, “Nasty leaves no marks. Nasty is disappearing into a black bag and being dragged into van, never to be seen again”\n“He’s right.” Indy says, holding his hands up “Pick saved my arse that day, almost everyone else got bagged” he pats me on the shoulder in gratitude.\n“Enough!” Brass orders, “Normally I’d love to prance down memory lane with you, but we have precious little time. Let’s finish this meeting and get our arses in gear, agreed?”\nA murmur of agreement comes from the group.\n“Randian, pass the joint to Pick, you’ve had way more than your share.”\nRandian dutifully obeys, holding the significantly diminished joint.\nI fiddle the joint in my fingers and inhale in a short wisp, carefully avoiding any possibility of another ember burning my palm.\nBrass sighs impatiently.\n“What do they call you?” he grunts.\n“You know what they call me”\n“Toothpick”\n“Icepick”\n“Ice prick”\n“Icepick”\n“Why do they call you-”\nHis sentence is cut short when I raise the bottle in the air and bring it crashing down over Brass’ head. He tumbles backwards, loses his footing and falls to the floor.\n“You want to know why they call me Icepick you fucking pussy?” I bark, leaning over him with the bottle outstretched.\nPogo bursts into fits of shrill laughter, screeching and hollering like a man possessed.\nHe looks up at me, his eyes rolling, trying to regain focus from the stun.\n“Answer me!” I spit, kicking him sharply in the ribs.\nI glance across to Sadie, who rolls her eyes unamused.\nIndy steps forward, gripping my arm roughly, twisting the bottle free from my hand.\n“Let him be Pick!” He growls, “You’re spilling the whisky.”\nI relent, stepping backwards. I turn to Indy.\n“Give me a cig” I pant.\nIndy reaches into his pocket and thumbs out a cigarette.\n“I want half of that Pick” He says as he hands it over.\n“Where’s your lighter?”\n“You had it last”\nI reach into my jacket pocket and find the lighter, spark my cigarette, and hand the lighter back to him. I inhale deeply, then stoop down, extending my arm to Brass, who grips it, and I help him up.\n“Sorry about that Brass” I grin, “sometimes I overreact.”\nBrass rubs his head.\n“You’re not fucking wrong” He chuckles dryly, straightening his Mohawk out with his palms, “But don’t apologise” He grins, “our whole game is overreaction, at least I know you can be trusted now”.\nI hand Brass the cigarette and he inhales deeply, as a small trickle of blood escapes from the swelling bruise on the top of his head.\n“Good” I say, “Because I dropped the joint when I did that, and now it’s in that puddle.”\nI point down to the spot where the remainder of the joint floats listlessly.\n“So what now Brass?” Sadie asks, “Do we carry on with the campfire thing or what?”\n“Nah, fuck it.” Brass responds, handing the cigarette back to me “We’re all grime, I know it.”\n“So what’s the plan, funny man?” Pogo asks\n“Right” Brass says, puffing his chest out to reassert his authority, “A blue cash-in-transit van will be passing under the bypass bridge at around 2am.” I nod attentively.\n“And we are going to stop it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(C) JC Axe 2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original Content: &lt;a href=\"http://jcaxefiction.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/xfaction1/\"&gt;http://jcaxefiction.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/xfaction1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"X Faction Soldiers – Part 1\nI pace about anxiously, counting how many steps it takes to cross the width of the alleyway and back again, then folding that number over into how many times I’d made the crossing. So far, I’d taken 481 steps. This seemed like an unusual number of steps, considering it takes six paces to cross the alley, and twelve if you include the return journey. I must have taken an extra step or miscounted somewhere.\nCouldn’t have picked a worse place to meet. The alleyway is open at both ends; a narrow corridor which blasts cold air all over you and up your sleeves every time the wind blows. I tug the sleeves of my jacket impatiently; the leather tightens across my back slightly before relaxing again. I stop pacing, having lost count around the 490 mark. Fuck it. I glance briefly at my comrade as he toddles about casually, swaying from side to side in no particular direction, intermittently putting the bottle to his lips and gulping insatiably.\nThey should be here by now. I know we didn’t get the location wrong. Maybe Pyrus got it wrong, dozy fuck probably got the time and date wrong too. He never was much good at, well anything, but a job is a job, and this one sounds important. This is just what I need to get back into it.\nThe alleyway is littered with old bags of rubbish, many of them torn and split or flattened down by cars. I’d already finished reading my paper, The English Standard, and had cast it to the ground, stamping my heel on the image of the flag, grinding mud into it. Broken glass glistens along the edge of the walls, and the whole place stinks of stale piss. Underneath a layer of topsoil blackened by motor oil and tyre tracks, old cobbles protrude sparsely, revealing the original level of the street and betraying the age of the alley. Cobblestones; who knows when they were first lain. Could have seen three wars for all I know, could have seen four.\nI hold out my hand to my comrade and motion for him to hand the bottle to me. Greedy fucker will end up finishing it before I’ve had a swig otherwise. He hands the bottle to me reluctantly and eyes me enviously as I open my gullet and swallow as much as I can. As the initial sourness fades from my tongue, the alcohol hits my stomach, and an illusory internal warmth spreads upwards from my midriff to my oesophagus. I peer across at him, as he stares on expectantly. I close my eyes and choke back two more mouthfuls, which is more than I can usually hack in one go, but I force it down anyway to spite him, before handing it back. The sourness of the drink is quickly washed away by the feeling of thick saliva creeping up from my throat as my stomach churns in protest. I thrust my arm in his direction, handing the bottle back to him, and spit the excess saliva onto the ground. The warmth of the alcohol, and the mild nausea it brings, mellow together into a creamy release of queasiness and comfort. I close my eyes and exhale deeply relaxing my arms, welcoming the sharp wisps of cold air, savouring the bittersweet feeling.\nI once again survey the alleyway, inhospitable and ugly, the local councils invested a great deal of money into removing, blocking off or paving over areas such as this. The entire architecture of a conurbation could be chopped and changed, to remove any pockets of darkness, grime or obscurity. Modern dormitory towns were made up of cul-de-sacs, circling a central hub of grassland, so that each house could be seen from every other. The notion was that such architectural design would minimise criminal activity, and ensure the safety of the common man. In reality, the idea was to create an almost panoptic system of self-surveillance, coercing conformity and compliance, and minimising any recalcitrance amongst the working classes. Alleyways like this, though inhospitable and dead, were in essence a breeding ground for insubordination. In these grim and filthy pockets, obscured from prying eyes, men could truly exercise their intrinsic human right to independent thought, free assembly and affirmative action against the dominant ethos.\n“Got any fags?” I ask motioning with my finger.\n“Fuck off Pick, you’ve had shit-loads of mine” he protests\n“So fuck! You got any or what? I don’t go to war without a fag” I snap at him.\nI survey him as he reaches into the inside pocket of his waistcoat, pulls out a cigarette packet and throws them to me aggressively. I catch it, thumb one out and throw the pack back in his chest. He tries to catch the pack in vain, and then hunches down to pick it up off the ground. I snigger as he hunches over, gripping the grimy bowler hat on his head to stop it from falling off.\nMr Industry, or Indy to those who knew him, always wore a bowler hat, a loose tie, and a grubby frayed waist coat. It wasn’t really a waistcoat, at one point it had been the jacket of a luxurious Italian suit. He’d ripped the sleeves off some time ago, revealing the yellowing sleeves of a white polo shirt underneath, which he’d clumsily sown cuff links to. On the left sleeve he wore a Deadeye Totenkopf emblem, on the right, a twisted Ankh. He bulged out of his clothes- they were salvaged like mine-, and were at least two sizes too small.\nThe mock-formal wear ended at the top and the bottom of his person. His shoes were steel toe-capped leather work boots, though the leather had peeled and cracked at the toe, revealing the metal underneath. The bowler hat sat clumsily on a crown of short and spiky blood red hair, flecked sparsely with splashes of orange and purple. Stocky in stature, Indy was often mistaken for being flabby and out of shape, because although he was deceptively strong, more so than myself, his muscle lacked any definition whatsoever, giving him the appearance of being somewhat doughy.\n“Got a lighter Indy?” I ask, as he returns to an upright position, having retrieved his cigarette packet.\nHe looks at me apathetically.\n“You don’t even have a lighter?”\n“Aw fuck this!” I spit, “when are these faggots getting here?”\nIndy fumbles with the bottle and the cigarettes to find his lighter.\n“Shut up with your fucking whinging Pick, it takes as long as it takes, this isn’t a weekend break in the Cotswolds” he says mockingly.\n“It’s not a wank in a wind tunnel either. I’m not waiting all night”\nIndy hands me a lighter and I hastily light my cigarette, put it in my mouth and tug again at my sleeves. This jacket is too small, the sleeves run up and the wind runs up my arms, hitting my chest. The cold doesn’t bother me that much, I ‘m always cold. You live in squats for years on end and you learn to cope with it. It’s the waiting I can’t stand, makes me irritable. But I owe much of my success to my itchy feet and impatience. Ducks sit, crows fly and vultures pick the bones; that’s how me and Indy had stayed off the radar for so long.\nNowhere was safe for guys like us. X faction soldiers, Grimesters, Punk insurgents, Neo-anarchists, whatever the fuck they want to call us. For us, life is war, a constant perennial conflict. We remained separate, individual in action but collective in our ideology, a loose fraternity. X faction soldiers, the real ones I mean, lived in and out of slums and squats, remaining transient, uprooted and free. We travelled by night, hitched lifts, stole cars or rode the rails, and we never stayed in one place for too long. The first one to lay his head was the first one to lose it.\nI unzip my fly and let loose a stream of piss, aiming for the muddied flag of The English Standard. I watch as the urine soaks into the paper, and the colours fade into sepia.\nMuch was said about the ideology of the X faction, the media demonised us, the police and government hated us, and the general public feared us, but to say we followed an ideology was erroneous. It would be more fitting to describe us as anti-moral. We have little in the way of a prophetic vision of a world after the war is won, nor any plans to seize power or sanction any kind of great change. We are not politicians, nor philosophers. We simply detest the state of the nation, the draconian government which fosters it, and the indifferent apathetic majority who suffer it. To us the war is everywhere; to us the enemy is everyone. Anything we can do to break the party’s control, upset the balance of power, or disturb the established order is a victory. It doesn’t matter much what it was we do. Everyone in England, even those who refused to believe it, is being repressed and our civil liberties and human rights have been steadily eroded by the new government since the end of the fourth world war. Reckless abandon and wanton destruction, to me seems like the only action to further the cause of sanity, in a country swept up in a fever of madness. What else could I do to battle an authority that cultivated a culture of constant trespass upon the right to live in decency and dignity? What else could be spawned from such trespass but loathsome, undignified creatures such as ourselves?\n \nI zip up my fly, watching the steam rise from the puddle, dissipating into the night air as the stream meanders around the cobblestones and broken glass.\nRebellion lay in the hearts of every man, but a man can spend his whole life keeping his head down, walking in step, and remaining compliant, knowing he is being exploited. It is only when he gets angry that he takes action, only after he’s seen the grotesque, fucked up face of our society for what it really is that he will make a stand. Destruction of any kind would unsettle the government and the people they control. It didn’t need to be aimed at anyone in particular. You could splash acid into the face of a police officer, burn a bank to the ground, or defecate in a public fountain. It didn’t matter. Every action that stirred up horror, misery or pain widened the area of sanity in which progress could be made, and fuelled the anger that would eventually culminate in the overthrow of our corrupt fascist leaders.\nOur emancipation from central leadership gives us the freedom to act autonomously, completely independent of command. There is no hierarchy to break, no ranks to infiltrate, no head honchos for the Big Boots to bag ‘n’ drag, no documents to burn, no stratagems to foil, no territory to invade, no castle with which to lay siege. The only victory anybody can hope for is to shut us down one individual cell at a time. That is how our movement survives. The individual may die or disappear, but the collective consciousness lives on.\nA gust of wind causes an ember to break away from the end of my cigarette, landing on the palm of my hand. I wince in pain momentarily as the ember dies. The sensation of searing flesh on my palm is an all too vivid memory, briefly reanimated by the ember.\nIndy looks across at me sympathetically. An uncommon sight from a man as wholly non-empathetic as he. I squint back at him bitterly, resentful of his pitying looks. The faction has time for camaraderie, and even to some degree compassion, but never sympathy. A true Grimester could hobble into a squat, sick, hungry or injured, and he would be taken care of to the best standard available, but no level of emotive compassion was wasted on one another. In part, this was to weed out the weak; those of soft heart who would rat out their comrades to the Big Boots if they got captured, but it wasn’t just that. The life of a Grimester meant that you could be sitting in a warehouse getting fucked up with your closest allies one minute, and be running for your life the next. Friends came and went, and it wasn’t just the transient lifestyle that precipitated it, people you knew personally could be literally dragged away with a bag over their head, and in an instant they were never seen again.\nThough we have nobody to answer to, our faction has a spiritual leader; an enigma of a man known as X. Much was spoken about X, but very little was actually known. He communicated entirely through a single soldier, Zero, whose mystery status was almost on a par with X himself. X was our inspiration. Ever since the Hostis Publicus Act was passed back in 2037, the ruling party has had free rein to arrest, interrogate and execute anybody deemed to be an enemy of the public.\n \nX was public enemy number one, closely followed by Zero, and a number of other notorious Grimesters. The list was based on notoriety and perceived threat to the domestic security of the nation. The top ranks were a veritable list of serial killers, master bomb makers, and Hacktivists. Further down the list were philosophers and intellectuals and former academics, who’d publicly shunned government legislation.\n \nMuch was said about X in the media. For a person whom nobody knew much about, people had no trouble attaching labels to him; Mass murderer, Lunatic, Schizophrenic, Psychotic, Rapist, Terrorist, Racist, Homophobe, Drug addict, Paedophile, Bank robber… The list was endless. All I knew about X was based on the accounts of other Punk insurgents, which were likely as flawed as tabloid reports themselves. For what I knew, he was an immensely powerful individual, both in his semantic aptitude, and his physical prowess. X was both feared and revered by both his enemies and his allies. His charisma was magnetic, and his command of language was palpable, a sabre-tongued overseer who could metaphorically whip a crowd into a frenzy in an instant, inciting infectious rioting amongst a localised population. Physically, he was believed to be immensely strong, and capable of withstanding colossal echelons of punishment. Rumour had it that he was often directly involved in the acts of destruction carried out by the insurgents, never shying away from a fight or a riot.\n \nThe hum of an engine approaches in the distance. My ears prick up. It is a petrol engine. That’s something. The police and the Big Boots, their vehicles are always diesel. There’s a slight but noticeable difference in the sound of the engine, knowing that is the difference between being bagged and dragged, or making a stealthy escape.\nA car pulls around the corner into the alleyway. The headlights are off. The thing is falling to bits. Either stolen or abandoned. It doesn’t matter. No vehicle is maintained, once they stop moving, we leave them where they stand.\nA man with a red Mohawk and a leather jacket not dissimilar to my own sits at the steering wheel. He locks eyes with me, grimaces, and climbs hastily out of the car, followed in turn by a young girl and another man of similar build to Indy. I glance at first at the man with the Mohawk, then at the man who is still in the car, and from his misshapen yellow teeth, I realise quickly that I know who he is. The girl is not familiar, but I eye her up from head to toe and supress a grin.\n“You here for the job?” The man with the red mohawk asks impatiently.\n“No” I spit, “we’re selling rainbow coloured unicorn spunk. You took your fucking time.”\n“And what? Stop fucking whining” He imprecates, turning to Indy, “What do they call you?”\n“Indy.” He nods, “Mr Industry for short”\n“And your friend?”\n“Pick. Short for Icepick.”\nHe turns to look at me, sniggering.\n“Icepick?” He laughs, “Look at him, all skin, bones and no bollocks.”\n“Fuck you” I scowl, “I’ll skin your bones if you carry on like that”\n“Settle down, Toothpick.” He mocks, “What you even doing on this job anyway? You look like a skinny faggot.”\n“Don’t worry about Pick” Indy interjects, “Pick can be a cold blooded fucker when he needs to be.” He nods reassuringly, “What do they call you?”.\n“I’m Brass.” He nods.\nI take a moment to examine Brass. He stands at about 6ft5, with a thick red Mohawk adding an extra foot to his height. His height is in proportion to the broadness of his shoulders, and although his jacket is made of thick cowhide, he clearly has a muscular physique. His face is clean shaven, or perhaps he does not grow much facial hair. The tops of a spider web tattoo can be seen encroaching on his neck, where a thick steel chain hangs loosely, tucked into his jacket. His right ear is adorned with an earring in the shape of a twisted Ankh and a Yin Yang twisted into the shape of an Infinity symbol. His hands seem to be permanently clenched into fists, and I can see that this is because he is wearing chrome-plated brass knuckles. His jeans are black and ripped at the knees, tucked into a pair of thick leather stomping boots, one of which has been bandaged with electrical tape. Lines form on his face, making him seem as if he is permanently snarling and frowning.\n“And this is Pogo” He says, pointing to his comrade whom I’d noticed earlier; a portly man with a snarling contorted face. I’d seen pictures of him in The English Standard and other newspapers. He was shorter than the papers made him look, despite this, no still photo or video clip could do him justice; his whole character exuded a palpable dread, so much that I struggle to focus on any one part of his face.  His lips twitch intermittently, revealing a set of jarred yellowing teeth. His eyes dart about rapidly as though he is constantly sniggering at something. His face is plastered in thick white make up, or maybe its paint. Around his eyes and lips, sharp shapes are painted in blue, with thick black outlines. His hair is bright blue and spikey, like a demonic jester. His clothes are baggy and striped vertically, splattered randomly with various colours, mainly blue and red. His hands are almost as white as his face, and his fingernails are long and sharp, as if they’ve been filed into talons.\nBrass points his thumb backwards towards the girl.\n“And she doesn’t go by any name.”\n“Yes I do” she snaps.\n“Yeah, but not one anybody cares about.” Brass sniggers.\nI look at the girl. She looks decidedly unamused. Her hair is black and jagged, that hangs in long limp strands in places, and is cut nearly down to the scalp in others. Her eyes are dark and heavy, her face smeared with roughly applied makeup, and bright red lipstick which is smeared around her mouth. Her clothes are predominantly black and lacy, frayed and ripped at the edges, a black leather strap hangs over her shoulder, attached to a small bag which hangs at her waist. She is petite, and holds a look of vulnerability about her, which I’m certain is put on deliberately.\n“You all know the plan?” Brass asks, addressing the group.\n“Yes” everybody murmurs in unison.\n“Well that’s fucking funny, because I haven’t even told you what it is yet.” Brass grunts, spitting on the ground.\n“Where are the others?” He grunts irately.\n“Others?” I ask, frustrated at the thought of having to wait for more people.\n“Yes, the others.” Brass spits, “There are three groups of us.”\n“Ah fuck waiting for them.” I groan.\n“We’re waiting, and you’re waiting with us.” He retorts, “We’ll need more muscle. Can’t go to war with a toothpick and a fat cunt can we?” He sniggers.\n“Hey! We’ve put the field time in, we’re more than capable of taking down a van.” Indy affirms.\n“Oh, so you must be the brains of the outfit eh?” Brass responds poking Indy in his forehead sharply. He turns to me.\n“And fuck me, I guess that make you the beauty, doesn’t it Ice Prick?”\nPogo lets out a cackle, as the girl rolls her eyes and looks away impatiently.\nI raise my eyebrows and fix him with a pitying stare.\n“Your woman looks embarrassed.” I nod towards the girl.\n“What’s the matter sweetheart? Not getting enough of the good stuff from handsome over here?” I say, tapping Brass on the chest.\n“Get fucked.” She spits at me, “Scrawny faggot, you don’t look like you could fuck your way out of a paper bag.”\n“That’s fine, you look like you’ve sucked your way all the way down the soup line at the city mission many times.” I snigger.\n“Handbags away ladies, can we focus on the task at hand, please?” Indy interjects.\n“And what task is that, Indy?” I ask , “Right now, all we’re doing is waiting on yet another group of punks, who are probably too busy dry-wanking themselves to sleep in a warehouse somewhere to have even made the effort to turn up.”\n“Actually” A voice comes from above, “I’ve been waiting longer than you have”.\nI look up to see a stocky African man with a shaved head standing on the roof of the alleyway above us.\n“What the fuck?” Indy says in shock.\n“Somebody had to keep a look out.” He says smugly, “It seems that you guys were too busy measuring dicks to keep focussed.”\nThe man jumps dangles from the edge of the roof, then drops to the floor among us.\nHe is tall and reasonably muscular, wearing little more than a black denim jacket a plain black shirt and jeans. His image is less than distressing, as would be expected from a Grimester. With no visible tattoos, piercings or attire, he could have passed for a civilian.\n“You the boy?” Brass asks irate.\n“I’m the man.” He winks, “Prince Randian. And you are Brass, Pogo, Mr Industry and Icepick.” He responds, highlighting our failure to sweep the area for prying eyes.\n“Your name I didn’t catch.” He says, pointing to the girl.\n“That’s Sadie.” Brass says, “Sadie by name, sadistic bitch by nature.”\nSadie smiles wickedly.\n“You can come out now” Randian shouts.\nA man appears from around the corner of the back alley. I look him up and down, and dismiss him immediately as a comrade. He is a dejected, apathetic man. His hair is long and scraggly and his clothes baggy and plain. His mouth hangs open slightly and his arms swing low by his side.\n“Who the fuck is this?” I turn to Randian.\n“This is Brain”\n“Brain-fucking-dead if you ask me.” Brass adds. I chuckle softly at Brass’ comment and our eyes meet briefly, our mutual dislike of Brain becoming our temporary common ground.\nBrain continues to stare vacantly, as though unaware he is being ridiculed.\n“Right”, Brass says stepping forwards, asserting leadership, “If that’s all of us, let’s get a campfire meeting underway, we’re already short on time.”\nAh, the campfire meeting. The ritualistic smoking of Menstrual Minstrel, or some other cannabinoid, followed by the talking of shit. Theories differed on why we did this; some related it to the actions of the Hashshashins in 11th century Syria, who would smoke Hashish after committing murders. Personally, I think that story is bollocks, made up by posers trying to make their recreational drug use seem profound and deep. I think it’s done to root out undercover spies. A true X insurgent comes into regular contact with drugs, and won’t lose their head. A police officer gets piss tested every week, and the Big Boots can’t even drink, but most importantly, when you’re under the influence of Minstrel, the memories you have are so vivid, it feels as though you’re reliving every second of it in real time. It can be seen on your face, in your eyes, and in your voice. An undercover spy couldn’t put on that kind of performance.\nBrass pulls a joint out from his jacket pocket.\n“Who wants to go first?” He says, brandishing it about like a dagger.\n“Fuck that Brass” Indy snaps, “Why’d you pre-roll? I don’t trust it. Roll one right here, right now.”\n“I did it to save time.” He snaps.\n“You were the ones who were late, we got here on time. Roll a new one.”\nBrass reaches into his pocket and throws a bag of Minstrel, along with various paraphernalia at Indy, who catches it clumsily.\n“You fucking roll it then, Mr Impotent.” He growls angrily.\nIndy opens the baggy a little, and sniffs it deeply.\n“What kind of Minstrel is this?” He asks.\n“It’s not Minstrel, it’s Lucipher’s Pubes.” Brass responds.\n“Ah, I don’t like pubes, kinda burns my throat.”\n“I don’t give a flying fuck about your throat, roll it up and smoke it, before I fuck you in the throat.”\nA few minutes pass in silence, whilst Indy layers tobacco and the red herbs together, and rolls it into a joint.\n“Roller’s rights I suppose, so I’ll go first.” Indy says holding the joint between his thumb and index finger.\n“Rock out with your cock out.” Brass responds vacantly.\nIndy puts the joint in his mouth, lights the end and inhales sharply. The effect can be felt immediately, no matter how much you smoke; part of the popularity of Rougecannabinoids are that the effects of tolerance are minimal.  Indy holds a lungful for about ten seconds before exhaling.\n“What do they call you and why?” Brass asks.\n“My name is Mr Industry” He replies in a hoarse voice, “I get my name because I burnt down a factory in Hammersmith, and because of my Captain of Industry attire.”\n“What did the factory produce?”\n“Automotive parts”\n“How did you do it?”\n“I used to work there when I was a civilian. I stayed back one night after work, hid in the changing rooms. Started the fire using petrol and oil soaked rags.”\nBrass raises one eyebrow, as if he suspects Indy might be lying.\n“What have you done lately?”\n“Smashed up a set of traffic lights at Piccadilly circus. Firebombed a lorry depot. Shaved off my pubes and mixed them into the coffee grounds at CoffeeGo.”\nPogo chuckles lightly at this.\n“What weapons do you use?”\n“Molotovs for destruction, knives and clubs for fighting, whatever I can get my hands on. Bottles, whatever.”\n“Why did you join the X Faction?”\n“Because the Industrial revolution created a war machine. Post-Industrial nations are stuck in a state of perpetual, unwinnable war, fuelled by the debt-driven rat race. The only way to free humanity from war and economic slavery is to break the whole system apart.”\n“Pass it on.” Brass nods, convinced Indy is legitimate.\nIndy hands the joint to Brain, who put it to his lips and draws hastily.\n“Name?” Brass asks curtly.\n“Brain” He replies softly.\n“Why do they call you Brain?”\n“Because my name is Brian, and it got spelt wrong.”\n“And you just told me your real name!” Brass shouts viciously, “What is wrong with you? Your mother drop a brick on your head?”\nBrain looks at the ground dejectedly.\n“Answer me!” Brass demands.\n“No she didn’t” He mutters submissively, “It got spelt wrong.”\n“What have you done for the X faction, Brain?”\n“I put a piranha in a public fountain once”\n“And what else?”\n“I shat in a golf ball cleaner at the country club and it got-“\n“-You’re not ready for this Brain. This is balls-to-the-brick, hammers in the air, ready to smash, you understand? No fucking about. This is the real shit. This is insurgency. You’ve got to have big brass balls, are you prepared?”\n“I think so”\n“Are you prepared!?” Brass snaps angrily.\n“Yeah, I’m prepared.” He responds with a little more fervour.\nBrass sighs wearily.\n“What weapons do you use?”\n“I’ve got a Luger from Germany.”\nThis sparks Brass’ interest.\n“You have a Luger?”\n“Yes, I got it converted in Hackney, from a replica, but now it fires real bullets.” Brain grins, “It’s one of those revolvey-type ones.”\n“Show it to me.” Brass demands.\nI step forward from the circle.\n“Luger’s don’t revolve, Brain-Bollocks” I shake my head in disappointment, “You own a revolver. The clue is in the name, fucktard.”\nBrass nods his head in agreement, before turning back to face Brain.\n“Where is your gun Brain?”\n“I left it at the squat.” He murmurs.\n“Oh fuck me…” Brass presses a hand to his face.\nAfter a moment, he asks the final question.\n“Why did you want to become an X faction soldier?”\n“It’s the only thing I’m good at doing.” He replies softly.\n“Right” Brass says, unimpressed, “Pass it on”.\nBrain looks around at the circle vacantly, passing the joint to Sadie.\n“What do they call you, and why?” Brass asks.\n“Some people call me Scalpel Sadie.”\n“-And why?” Brass reiterates.\n“Because I’m a fucking surgeon.” She giggles.\n“And what have you done for the insurgency?”\n“I hitch-hike. I wait for my white knight to pick me up from the side of the road. Then when he tries to collect his fare, I get surgical.”\n“What do you mean?” I ask intrigued.\n“Sometimes it’s just a little keyhole surgery, or maybe a circumcision, but some dogs need to be fully snipped, otherwise they’ll never learn to behave.”\n“You cut off men’s dicks?!” Indy blurts out in awe, before succumbing to a fit of giggles, “That’s fucked up!”\nBrass, evidently already aware of this, nods along unamused.\n“You hear that Brain?” I nudge him in the ribs, “You might get lucky, Sadie might drain your main vein!” I laugh.\nBrain shuffles away from me nervously.\n“Need we ask what weapons you use?” Brass grins.\nSadie slides two scalpels out from each sleeve of her jacket, stands in the centre of the circle, and twirls around playfully with her arms out at her sides and the joint in her mouth, before returning to her position.\n“Why did you join the X Faction, Sadie?” Brass asks impartially.\n“The world fucked me.” She laughs, “So I fuck it up.” She says, slashing forwards with the scalpel.\n“Pass it on.” Brass nods unflinching.\nNext in the circle is Pogo. I’d anticipated this since I saw him exit the car.\nPogo clutches the joint in his jagged teeth, and widens his eyes in anticipation.\n“What do they call you and why?” Brass says hastily.\n“They call me Pogo!” He beams in a voice that almost sounds bi-tonal, as if two people are talking at once, one tone is deep and gravelly, whilst the other is a shrill whistle.\n“The magical mystical musical clown, entertaining every town!” He chuckles.\nBrass hesitates a little, as if he is a little nervous about speaking with Pogo.\n“Right.” He says dropping his eyelids briefly, “And what have you done for the X Faction?”\nI step forward once again, unable to contain myself.\n“We all know what he’s done! He’s Pogo the fucking clown, the Jaded Jester.” I say, turning to face Pogo himself.\n“If the devil himself walked the streets of London, he’d run from this sick cunt!” I laugh in star-struck awe.\n“You killed Violet Tate-Jones” I say locking eyes with the clown.\n“She was  walking down the stairs, wearing lacy underwear, didn’t know of Pogo there. Oh she screams and how she stares! Scream the house down, no-one cares!”\nThe murder of Violet Tate-Jones had sparked a day of mourning in England. Every tabloid newspaper was filled with tributes to the one they called ‘Hollywood’s answer to Princess Diana’. Not only was she an A-List actress, but also fancied herself as a peace ambassador to the breakaway states of Eastern Europe and South East Asia, frequently visiting war zones to carry out humanitarian aid and deliver peace talks. One day at her home in London, she was violently murdered by an X faction grime punk, known to the police and papers as the Jaded Jester. To those of us who frequented the sub-cities, he was Pogo the clown, a notorious serial killer and cannibal. I’d always had a fascination with the darker side of the human psyche, and Pogo was about as fucked up as you could get.\n“How did she scream?” I ask, leaning my face towards Pogo.\nA wicked grin spreads across his face, cracking his white makeup.\n“Like a banshee.” He giggles.\n“I am a mechanical boy, I am my mother’s toy. Don’t do anything illegal, always beware of the eagle!” He sings menacingly.\nI furrow my brows and lean in towards him.\n“What does it mean?” I ask in a hushed tone, optimistically hoping for a deeper insight into the machinations of Pogo’s mind.\nBrass grips my shoulder and pulls me backwards.\n“I’m asking the questions!” He growls.\nI return to my place in the circle, as Brass steps into the centre once more.\n“What weapons do you use Pogo?”\nPogo withdraws a machete from his trouser leg and waves it around in the air haphazardly.\n“Pogo likes toys that make no noise.” He giggles, replacing the machete.\nBrass breathes deeply, relieved that Pogo had replaced his weapon.\n“Why did you join the insurgency?”\nPogo closes his eyes and sticks his tongue out.\n“For fun!”\n“Pass it on.”\nThe joint is passed to Prince Randian, who wipes the roach with his coat sleeve before placing it in his mouth and inhaling lightly.\n“What’s your name and why?”\n“Prince Randian.” He nods, “Ever seen a man roll a cigarette and light it using just his lips?”\nBrass squints at him, confused.\n“Randian can.” He nods.\n“Whatever.” Brass “What have you done for the cause?”\n“I hacked into the computers at the Bank of England, altered the software and produced GrimeNote” He says conceitedly.\nGrimeNote, considered by some to be the X Faction currency. In reality, it was little more than a novelty or an ornament, but it was used occasionally by Grimesters, not so much for trade, but more as tokens of appreciation for acts of camaraderie. The story hit the papers when a number of bank notes entered circulation with an image of the king’s head, decayed and burning, with a Deadeye Totenkopf carved into his forehead, and a twisted Ankh protruding from his head; the symbols of the insurgency. Much of the currency was seized and destroyed, but a lot of the notes were still circulating. The action lead to many grime punks defacing bank notes on mass to replicate the original GrimeNotes. I held a few original GrimeNotes myself, but it had always perplexed me as to how the notes had made it from the Royal Mint directly into the hands of the public without detection.\n“So you’re one of those neo-techno-cyber-anarchists or whatever” Sadie chides.\n“Primarily yes” Randian responds, “Economic terrorism can be just as, if not more effective, than shitting in golf ball cleaners or murdering innocent celebrities.”\nHe nods towards Brain and Pogo.\n“But if your concern is that I haven’t had time in the field, you won’t leave here in any doubt that I can fight.”\n“What weapons do you use?” Brass interjects, growing weary of Randian, “You’d better have brought more than a laptop.” He says, sniggering.\n“I use my hands and my feet.” He grins, “I don’t need a knife to make a man bleed.”\nThis level of brash arrogance irritates me.\n“Oh fuck off” I spit, “Tough as old boots are you?” I say, stepping forward and jabbing Randian in the chest.\n“Let’s see how hard you are when the Big Boots are stamping your face into a concrete floor.”\nRandian rolls his eyes mockingly.\n“I bet you can’t fight for shit.” I say raising a fist in the air.\n“Make me bleed, faggot.” I growl.\nBrass reaches his arm out, knocking me backwards.\n“He’s in.” Brass hisses, “I know who he is, and so should you.”\n“Yeah, I bet you do” I retort, “You know everybody, don’t you Brass?”\nBrass shrugs dismissively.\n“I get around.”\n“What makes you think you should be campfire leader anyway?” I ask cynically, “Half the people here are your buddies anyway, and Randian and the drugged up remedial? They were here before we even knew it. How do I know you aren’t all spies?” I say, waving my finger at them all.\n“I fucking dare you to say that again!” Sadie shouts.\n“Fuck you Sadie” I growl, “and that’s another thing Brass, who brings their girl along to a job like this?”\n“She isn’t my girl, we were just in the same squat.”\n“So maybe she’s bouncing on Pogo’s pogo-stick, whatever.”\n“Fuck that, are you serious!?” Sadie says outraged.\n“Reign it in Pick” Indy shouts, jabbing me in the chest firmly “They’re chicken soup, and you already knew Pogo anyway, you saw his picture in the papers.”\nI pick up the bottle from the ground and point it towards Randian. Indy steps in front of me shaking his head. I lower the bottle, breathe deeply, unscrew the lid and put it to my lips, swigging deeply.\nIndy had a point.\n“Yeah, give it a rest, Toothpick.” Brass growls, “You really think the Big Boots would go to this much effort just to bring you guys in?”\nI lower the bottle, and meet his gaze.\n“You aren’t exactly notorious.”\nMy face twitches a little, irate at Brass’ belittling comments.\n“And what makes you think we trust you two anyway?” He continues.\nI raise my hand, exposing the palm.\n“Look at my scar” I say, displaying it to the group.\nBrass looks at my burned palm keenly.\n“How’d you do that?” he asks inquisitively.\n“Big Boots raided a squat we had down in Brighton. I was sleeping.”\nBrass nods for me to continue.\n“I had my acky bomb, but I didn’t have my gloves.” I explain, “I got roughed up, grabbed my acky and smashed it over his face. Burned my hand.”\nBrass lets a wry smile cross his face.\n“Me and Indy escaped by jumping from a window. Turns out one of the punks was a spy, let the Boots in through the back door.”\n“Shit man” Brain says in awe, “that’s nasty”\n“No.” I say facing Brain, “Nasty leaves no marks. Nasty is disappearing into a black bag and being dragged into van, never to be seen again”\n“He’s right.” Indy says, holding his hands up “Pick saved my arse that day, almost everyone else got bagged” he pats me on the shoulder in gratitude.\n“Enough!” Brass orders, “Normally I’d love to prance down memory lane with you, but we have precious little time. Let’s finish this meeting and get our arses in gear, agreed?”\nA murmur of agreement comes from the group.\n“Randian, pass the joint to Pick, you’ve had way more than your share.”\nRandian dutifully obeys, holding the significantly diminished joint.\nI fiddle the joint in my fingers and inhale in a short wisp, carefully avoiding any possibility of another ember burning my palm.\nBrass sighs impatiently.\n“What do they call you?” he grunts.\n“You know what they call me”\n“Toothpick”\n“Icepick”\n“Ice prick”\n“Icepick”\n“Why do they call you-”\nHis sentence is cut short when I raise the bottle in the air and bring it crashing down over Brass’ head. He tumbles backwards, loses his footing and falls to the floor.\n“You want to know why they call me Icepick you fucking pussy?” I bark, leaning over him with the bottle outstretched.\nPogo bursts into fits of shrill laughter, screeching and hollering like a man possessed.\nHe looks up at me, his eyes rolling, trying to regain focus from the stun.\n“Answer me!” I spit, kicking him sharply in the ribs.\nI glance across to Sadie, who rolls her eyes unamused.\nIndy steps forward, gripping my arm roughly, twisting the bottle free from my hand.\n“Let him be Pick!” He growls, “You’re spilling the whisky.”\nI relent, stepping backwards. I turn to Indy.\n“Give me a cig” I pant.\nIndy reaches into his pocket and thumbs out a cigarette.\n“I want half of that Pick” He says as he hands it over.\n“Where’s your lighter?”\n“You had it last”\nI reach into my jacket pocket and find the lighter, spark my cigarette, and hand the lighter back to him. I inhale deeply, then stoop down, extending my arm to Brass, who grips it, and I help him up.\n“Sorry about that Brass” I grin, “sometimes I overreact.”\nBrass rubs his head.\n“You’re not fucking wrong” He chuckles dryly, straightening his Mohawk out with his palms, “But don’t apologise” He grins, “our whole game is overreaction, at least I know you can be trusted now”.\nI hand Brass the cigarette and he inhales deeply, as a small trickle of blood escapes from the swelling bruise on the top of his head.\n“Good” I say, “Because I dropped the joint when I did that, and now it’s in that puddle.”\nI point down to the spot where the remainder of the joint floats listlessly.\n“So what now Brass?” Sadie asks, “Do we carry on with the campfire thing or what?”\n“Nah, fuck it.” Brass responds, handing the cigarette back to me “We’re all grime, I know it.”\n“So what’s the plan, funny man?” Pogo asks\n“Right” Brass says, puffing his chest out to reassert his authority, “A blue cash-in-transit van will be passing under the bypass bridge at around 2am.” I nod attentively.\n“And we are going to stop it.”\n \nTo be continued…\n \n(C) JC Axe 2014\n\nOriginal Content: http://jcaxefiction.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/xfaction1/\n","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"2lrdod","gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"robinbastard","num_comments":0,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5ur","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/yourserial/comments/2lrdod/x_faction_soldiers_part_1_by_jc_axe/","name":"t3_2lrdod","created":1415540318,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/yourserial/comments/2lrdod/x_faction_soldiers_part_1_by_jc_axe/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"X Faction Soldiers – Part 1 | By JC Axe","created_utc":1415540318,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":false,"threadNum":1,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":2,"label":"negative"},{"question":"my name is john smith. what is my last name?","thread":{"domain":"self.AskReddit","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AskReddit","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is unique but I&amp;#39;ve always wondered how life would be I were a &amp;quot;John Smith&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Michael Johnson&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"My name is unique but I've always wondered how life would be I were a \"John Smith\" or \"Michael Johnson\"","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1olds9","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"ohsballer","num_comments":9,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/1olds9/whats_it_like_to_have_an_extremely_common_first/","name":"t3_1olds9","created":1381956734,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1olds9/whats_it_like_to_have_an_extremely_common_first/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"What's it like to have an extremely common first and last name?","created_utc":1381953134,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_1olds9","likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"cct2heq","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"DreadfulRauw","parent_id":"t3_1olds9","score":1,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"My name is pretty common.

Was this true I have seen other posts in this subreddit that seem to disagree with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they said the population was around 20,000(??). Do we know how it was broken down between the upper class, working class and slaves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everything was focusing on the upper class which is understandable I guess. But what was a day like for say a working class fisherman or merchant at the open market? When did they set out to fish? How long were they out to fishing? When did the market open and close? When did they get the deliveries of goods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did Pompeii compare to other Roman cities of the time?

They mentioned that the many of the slaves were treated pretty well, paid a wage and could eventually buy their freedom. I was curious how much they would have to pay for their freedom and how long it would take being paid their small wage to earn it. \n\n2. It was also stated that the location of Pompeii was forgotten after only a few years. Was this true I have seen other posts in this subreddit that seem to disagree with that.\n\n3. I think they said the population was around 20,000(??). Do we know how it was broken down between the upper class, working class and slaves?\n\n4.  Pretty much everything was focusing on the upper class which is understandable I guess. But what was a day like for say a working class fisherman or merchant at the open market? When did they set out to fish? How long were they out to fishing? When did the market open and close? When did they get the deliveries of goods?\n\n5. How did Pompeii compare to other Roman cities of the time? Was it considered well respected or wealthy or the opposite?\n\nI know that might be a lot and I appreciate any answers.

Sorry for the wall of text.\n     My wife and I are moving. I have a friend, who I asked for help, just showed up one day while I was away on business and started helping my wife pack our belongings. He has been helping us move for a month. He has been staying at my house, with my wife, while I am gone. The problem is that he has helped out enormously. He has packed up nearly everything in my garage and house in order to help us move. They load up my tuck and trailer, drive it to our new place, stay the night, unload and do it all over again. She says that he has never made any type of sexual comments or anything while doing so and says it&amp;#39;s because he just wants to help. He has his own place about a :45 drive from the house we are moving from but after helping my wife pack all day he is tired and just stays at my house. He has basically been my dependant for a month now. He also works for himself so he has no boss.\n     He drives my car because his truck gets a gas guzzling 8 mpg. I buy him food, smokes and gas when he needs. He just never goes away. I work away from home 7 days at a time then home for 7 days and he is there the entire time. Helping. When I complain to my wife about the lack of privacy she reminds me that without his help we would have a monumental task to accomplish by ourselves. We only have a few more weeks before we have to be out of our house. \nThe bigger problem is that I feel like I no longer have a say in anything as my wife always defends him because he has helped out so much. He has basically invaded our lives and I can&amp;#39;t just ask him to leave. \n      Our new place is 2.5 hours away from the old one and is very secluded. They both have a lot in common and get along well. Too well for my comfort. He likes to stay up extremely late around a small bonfire and chat with my wife. All while I am away. She always lets me know that they are just having a couple drinks around the fire and talking. while I am too tired to stay up any longer. Since I am away for 7 days at a time I miss my wife and want to spend some &amp;quot;quality time&amp;quot; with her. She prefers to stay up and chat with him while drinking beers around the fire. I have expressed my lack of tolerance for this and blew up completely the last time it happened. In a fit of rage I kicked over the portable fire pit with the fire still roaring, barely missing him. They both treated me like I was some maniacal asshole and she even said she was afraid I was going to hit her, which I have NEVER done. He didn&amp;#39;t even get mad. He never does.\n       He doesn&amp;#39;t ask for anything. He just helps himself. He takes my car to go to the store. He acts like he runs the household and whenever I call him out on his bullshit she defends him and treats me like I am just being jealous and insecure (which I am). Last week he actually walked through my house wearing only a small towel after showering, claiming he forgot his stuff in the other room. When I told him that if it happens again, he will be out on his ass before he gets dressed he apologized saying he wasn&amp;#39;t thinking and that it won&amp;#39;t happen again. Her entire family knows about the situation and is ok with it. He just went with my wife to my brother&amp;#39;s bachelor/bachelorette party in my place because I was away at work. Both my brothers and cousins were there as well and said nothing even slightly questionable happened. They didn&amp;#39;t even dance together.\n       I am having a huge problem with this but she just can&amp;#39;t seem to understand what the problem is. He has been a huge help the entire time, moving and fixing things in our new place. He can fix damn near anything but so can I. \nI truly believe in the deepest part of my being that she and him are not having an affair but I am still not cool with the arrangement.\n      Lastly, I was divorced 10 years ago from an almost identical situation. A friend was helping me build our house for a few weeks. Next thing I know, she wants a divorce. They now have a 7 year old son together.\n    I have asked my wife and &amp;quot;Joe&amp;quot; to at least try to see things from my perspective but all my efforts have been in vain. They see nothing wrong with it because he is helping us out tremendously.\nPLEASE FUCKING HELP ME!!! I am going out of my mind with jealous worry that history may repeat itself and my relationship with my wife has become strained because of it. \n   Best case scenario is that they are just good friends and he is truly trying to help OR- he is making himself comfortable in my home because he knows that I will be out of the picture soon.\n   Am I just being a jealous asshole or should I just let him help out?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR- My friend is helping us move and start a business and lives with us and stays at my house while I am away on business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Sorry, in my frustration I left this out.\nHe has also been helping us set up a new organic food business and has been working on that as well as helping us move. He has taken no cash except for minor bills saying he is just extremely excited about our business and wants to see us succeed. He has made numerous repairs and upgrades to our business building. All in the name of trying to be generously charitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT; Thanks to all who actually gave good advice- especially you G8r- it really helped me try to deal with this unusually awkward situation. She does keep in constant contact with me- especially at night so I think at this point that I will take it at face value that he really is there to help and that, even though most of you suspect that she is cheating, she has really never given me any reason to suspect that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE; I sent her 2 emails basically laying out hers/his behavior over the past few weeks. I was frank and honest about how I felt about the entire situation. She called me in tears explaining that she didn&amp;#39;t realize because she had been so busy packing and moving and that she was sorry. She asked &amp;quot;Joe&amp;quot; to leave for a few days so we could work things out. She also talked to &amp;quot;Joe&amp;quot; and explained that, as much as he had been a huge help to us, that we needed to figure this out for ourselves and shouldn&amp;#39;t be so dependant on him. She thought I was going to leave her which tore her to pieces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you G8r and those who left sound advice. Your helpful words kept me cool and it worked out great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"The situation. Sorry for the wall of text.\n     My wife and I are moving. I have a friend, who I asked for help, just showed up one day while I was away on business and started helping my wife pack our belongings. He has been helping us move for a month. He has been staying at my house, with my wife, while I am gone. The problem is that he has helped out enormously. He has packed up nearly everything in my garage and house in order to help us move. They load up my tuck and trailer, drive it to our new place, stay the night, unload and do it all over again. She says that he has never made any type of sexual comments or anything while doing so and says it's because he just wants to help. He has his own place about a :45 drive from the house we are moving from but after helping my wife pack all day he is tired and just stays at my house. He has basically been my dependant for a month now. He also works for himself so he has no boss.\n     He drives my car because his truck gets a gas guzzling 8 mpg.

Several of the waitresses would complement as they would prepare for their shifts and would tell me I should audition for American Idol.  On one particular day I jokingly took one of the waitresses up on her offer and announced that if American Idol was in town &amp;quot;this week,&amp;quot; I would go.

Randy was first and told me that he did not feel I &amp;quot;worked it out.&amp;quot;  He voted no.

He had this look on his face (you&amp;#39;ve seen it) and told me that my song was not very original and was like every other stupid pop song he had ever heard.  Simon said he was not interested in hearing any more from me but I blurted out the lines from the James Morrison song, &amp;quot;Wonderful World.&amp;quot;  It sounded something like this...  &amp;quot;I tripped on my way in, I got kicked outside and everybody sawwwww!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My face turned bright red.

So, I went to get him some milk (I don&amp;#39;t have a cat...so I didn&amp;#39;t have alot to offer the little guy).  Here&amp;#39;s what got me.  When he saw the milk in the bowl...he became very afraid.  HIs eyes darted left and right and he walked around the corner of the kitchen to see if anyone was there.  Slowly...yet still fearful...he began to drink.   He hurried out shortly after.  That&amp;#39;s when it hit me-Like that cat- It&amp;#39;s scarier when we want or need something!  THAT is when we are the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why don&amp;#39;t we ask for what we truly desire  F E A R.

They no the reward is worth it and haven&amp;#39;t had their hearts hurt by the world...yet.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s remember &amp;#39;No risk-no reward.&amp;#39;  And, the deeper the need we share-the more universal the connection we have with others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what are some of your deepest and silliest hopes and dreams for 2011  I&amp;#39;ll humbly (and somewhat anxiously) submit mine first:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Santa,\nI know you got alot on your plate...so here are a few requests: XBOX 760 (I want it to come out!), no WikiLeaks releases about myself, a meme that answers a question about myself, 6 inches of fresh powder for skiing,  a &amp;#39;double rainbow&amp;#39; moment for everyone in the reddit nation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note...Food and shelter for the hungry and destitute.  Sweet dreams for all the children at Riley Hospital-and all needy kids.  I want to have half the wisdom of my father.  I want my wife to keep her job next year (50 % will be cut).  I want another rally on the Mall in DC- &amp;#39;The Rally to Restore Humanity.&amp;#39;  World Peace.   Oh...and Santa..please give my neighbor&amp;#39;s cat all the milk he could ever want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"'Dear Santa...' - These words either fill us with wonder or contempt.  Kids everywhere write letters of their wants freely and uninhibited every year, yet as we get older we don't bother with such 'nonsense.'  But, most of us -I believe- are truly afraid to speak from our hearts (like kids do) and express what we truly want.\r\n\r\nStay with me here.  I remember this past summer our neighbors cat was meowing and trying to come in through our back door.  He had never been in our house before...so I was surprised when he just sauntered inside when I opened the door.

But do you think kids or animals care about this  NO.  They no the reward is worth it and haven't had their hearts hurt by the world...yet.  \r\n\r\nLet's remember 'No risk-no reward.'  And, the deeper the need we share-the more universal the connection we have with others.\r\n\r\nSo, what are some of your deepest and silliest hopes and dreams for 2011  I'll humbly (and somewhat anxiously) submit mine first:\r\n\r\nDear Santa,\r\nI know you got alot on your plate...so here are a few requests: XBOX 760 (I want it to come out!), no WikiLeaks releases about myself, a meme that answers a question about myself, 6 inches of fresh powder for skiing,  a 'double rainbow' moment for everyone in the reddit nation.\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note...Food and shelter for the hungry and destitute.

Indeed, you would probably be living underground at first, in a windowless cave, only this time there would be no wild horses to sketch on the ceiling.\n\nMade me to think about how valuable our beautiful Earth is; and how most of us tend to forget about it.\n\nSource(A great article, worth a read): http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"2ui87x","gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"am_at_work","num_comments":0,"score":7,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2smzw","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/Frisson/comments/2ui87x/textross_andersen_on_how_itd_feel_to_be_on_a/","name":"t3_2ui87x","created":1422874608,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/2ui87x/textross_andersen_on_how_itd_feel_to_be_on_a/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"[text]Ross Andersen on how it'd feel to be on a one-way trip to Mars; in \"The Elon Musk Interview\"","created_utc":1422874608,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":7},"comment":false,"threadNum":0,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":2,"label":"negative"},{"question":"who is dracula?","thread":{"domain":"self.AskReddit","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AskReddit","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"2nppc8","gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Stony_Curtis","num_comments":4,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/2nppc8/who_is_the_best_movietv_dracula/","name":"t3_2nppc8","created":1417220335,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2nppc8/who_is_the_best_movietv_dracula/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Who is the best movie/tv Dracula?","created_utc":1417220335,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_2nppc8","likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"cmfpey4","gilded":0,"archived":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Fgrira-Fpevoare","parent_id":"t3_2nppc8","score":6,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Bela Lugosi\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_Lugosi","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bela Lugosi\n&lt;a href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_Lugosi\"&gt;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_Lugosi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","subreddit":"AskReddit","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_cmfpey4","created":1417220430,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":1417220430,"ups":6,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},"threadNum":9,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":26,"label":"negative"},{"question":"convert the number 18 to binary","thread":{"domain":"self.thecherno","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"thecherno","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was quite shocked to hear The Cherno&amp;#39;s explanation of RGB colours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that the hex value of FFFFFF (or 0xFFFFFF as he explains it) is equal to 16,777,215.

A lot of people changed their service but we decided to stick with Time Warner Cable because they&amp;#39;re used to it. They like channel 1 (Local NYC 24hr news) and really had no desire to try something new. Grandfather had a stroke and is wheelchair bound, grandmother is busy all the time handling my grandfather&amp;#39;s appointments, meetings with PT/OT/ST etc... She&amp;#39;s handling it fairly well but her time is pressed. When she&amp;#39;s done for the day, they like to lay in bed and relax while watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last month, their bedroom set started pixelating. Picture became blocky and would freeze from time to time. It was hard for them to watch TV that way so they called TW customer service. They had to wait a couple of weeks but someone came on the 29th of December. The 2 techs came in, checked all the cables and made some adjustments. They then told my grandmother that there was an amplifier on the line and it was causing the problem. So they claimed they removed it. They left and the grandparents watched their shows that night. Unfortunately, the problem was still there. They called CS again, the CSR pinged the box and told them that they would send someone out to check out the set again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, a tech came.

I asked if they could just replace the box since he concluded it was a hardware problem. He said that they would do it on the 11th. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I asked him for an earlier date. He explained that he didn&amp;#39;t have the authority to do that and I would need to speak to a supervisor.

I told her my story, she said the 11th. I asked for an earlier date and she said that there is no one available until the 11th. I told her that they have been here 2x before and the problem progressively got worse with each service call. She said, &amp;quot;Again, there is no one available until the 11th.&amp;quot; I figured that was no way of getting through to her that my grandfather is wheelchair bound and had a stroke and that my grandmother is not able to take the box to a TW retail center to get it changed. She had appointments to keep for my grandfather&amp;#39;s rehabilitation. The supervisor said &amp;quot;Listen, the 11th is the earliest I can get you. I don&amp;#39;t know you and I&amp;#39;m just doing my job. The 11th, take it or leave it.&amp;quot; Feeling a little upset, I said I&amp;#39;ll take it. She said, the 11th between 8-11am and she quickly hung up. Unfortunately, she did not stay long enough on the line for me to tell her that they have a doctor&amp;#39;s appointment at that time and need a new time. I figured that this had to be resolved, so I called TWCS number again. I went through the same 15 minutes of automated responses and waited another 20 to actually talk to someone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new CSR listened to my story and said &amp;quot;ok, the box needs to be replaced. Someone will come tomorrow between 5-8pm.&amp;quot; I was happy and thanked him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before, I left I checked their junction box. i noticed an signal amplifier on the line and my mind started to churn.

What can I do to make sure this doesn&amp;#39;t happen again? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Seems like TWC lied again. We got a call this morning, they won&amp;#39;t be doing today&amp;#39;s service call because the CSR was not authorized to do so.

This is such bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Several months ago, Verizon service became available in my grandmother's building. A lot of people changed their service but we decided to stick with Time Warner Cable because they're used to it. They like channel 1 (Local NYC 24hr news) and really had no desire to try something new. Grandfather had a stroke and is wheelchair bound, grandmother is busy all the time handling my grandfather's appointments, meetings with PT/OT/ST etc... She's handling it fairly well but her time is pressed. When she's done for the day, they like to lay in bed and relax while watching TV. \n\nLast month, their bedroom set started pixelating. Picture became blocky and would freeze from time to time. It was hard for them to watch TV that way so they called TW customer service. They had to wait a couple of weeks but someone came on the 29th of December. The 2 techs came in, checked all the cables and made some adjustments. They then told my grandmother that there was an amplifier on the line and it was causing the problem. So they claimed they removed it. They left and the grandparents watched their shows that night. Unfortunately, the problem was still there. They called CS again, the CSR pinged the box and told them that they would send someone out to check out the set again.\n\nToday, a tech came. He replaced the box and showed it that the picture was clear. She agreed and he left. So they ate dinner and started watching their shows. For some reason the box rebooted itself.

It would be a romantic and glamorous tale, flavored with the scent of pines in Himalayan valleys, with garden courtyards in obscure parts of Alexandria, with mountain temples in Japan, and with secretive meetings and initiations in country houses adjoining Paris, New York, and Los Angeles. It would also raise some rather unexpected philosophical questions as to the relations between genuine mysticism and stage magic. But I have neither the patience nor the skill to be a novelist, and thus can do no more than sketch the idea for some more gifted author.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The attractions of being a trickster guru are many. There is power and there is wealth, and still more the satisfactions of being an actor without need for a stage, who turns “real life” into a drama. It is not, furthermore, an illegal undertaking such as selling shares in non-existent corporations, impersonating a doctor, or falsifying checks. There are no recognized and official qualifications for being a guru, though now that some universities are offering courses in meditation and Kundalini Yoga it may soon be necessary to be a member of the U.S. Fraternity of Gurus. But a really fine trickster would get around all that by the one-upmanship of inventing an entirely new discipline outside and beyond all known forms of esoteric teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It must be understood from the start that the trickster guru fills a real need and performs a genuine public service. Millions of people are searching desperately for a true father-Magician, especially at a time when the clergy and the psychiatrists are making rather a poor show, and do not seem to have the courage of their convictions or of their fantasies. Perhaps they have lost nerve through too high a valuation of the virtue of honesty – as if a painter felt bound to give his landscapes the fidelity of photographs. To fulfil his compassionate vocation, the trickster guru must above all have nerve. He must also be quite well-read in mystical and occult literature, both that which is historically authentic and sound in scholarship, and that which is somewhat questionable – such as the writings of H.P. Blavatsky, P.D. Ouspensky, and Aleister Crowley. It doesn’t do to be caught out on details now known to a wide public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After such preparatory studies, the first step is to frequent those circles where gurus are especially sought, such as the various cult groups which pursue oriental religions or peculiar forms of psychotherapy, or simply the intellectual and artistic milieux of any great city. Be somewhat quiet and solitary. Never ask questions, but occasionally add a point – quite briefly – to what some speaker has said. Volunteer no information about your personal life, but occasionally indulge in a little absent-minded name-dropping to suggest that you have travelled widely and spent time in Turkestan. Evade close questioning by giving the impression that mere travel is a small matter hardly worth discussing, and that your real interests lie on much deeper levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such behavior will soon provoke people into asking your advice. Don’t come right out with it, but suggest that the question is rather deep and ought to be discussed at length in some quiet place. Make an appointment at a congenial restaurant or cafe – not at your home, unless you have an impressive library and no evidence of being tied down with a family. At first, answer nothing, but without direct questioning, draw the person out to enlarge on his problem and listen with your eyes closed – not as if sleeping, but as if attending to the deep inner vibrations of his thoughts. Conclude the interview with a slightly veiled command to perform some rather odd exercise, such as humming a sound and then suddenly stopping. Carefully instruct the person to be aware of the slightest decision to stop before actually stopping, and indicate that the point is to be able to stop without any prior decision. Make a further appointment for a report on progress.\nTo carry this through, you must work out a whole series of unusual exercises, both psychological and physical. Some must be rather difficult tricks which can actually be accomplished, to give your student the sense of real progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others must be virtually impossible – such as to think of the words yes and no at the same instant, repeatedly for five minutes, or with a pencil in each hand, to try to hit the opposite hand – which is equally trying to defend itself and hit the other. Don’t give all your students the same exercises but, because people love to be types, sort them into groups according to their astrological sun signs or according to your own private classifications, which must be given such odd names as grubers, jongers, milers, and trovers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A judidous use of hypnosis – avoiding all the common tricks of hand-raising, staring at lights, or saying “Relax. Relax, while I count up to ten” will produce pleasant changes of feeling and the impression of attaining higher states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, describe such a stage quite vividly – say, the sense of walking on air – and then have your students walk around barefooted trying not to make the slightest sound and yet giving their whole weight to the floor. Imply that the floor will soon feel like a cushion, then like water, and finally like air. Indicate a little later that there is reason to believe that something of this kind is the initial stage of levitation.\nNext, be sure to have about thirty or forty different stages of progress worked out, giving them numbers, and suggest that there are still some extremely high stages beyond those numbered which can only be understood by those who have reached twenty-eight – so no point in discussing them now. After the walking-on-air gambit, try for instance having them push out hard with their arms as if some overwhelming force were pulling them. Reverse the procedure. This leads quickly to the feeling that one is not doing what one is doing and doing what one is not doing. Tell them to stay in this state while going about everyday business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while let it be known that you have a rather special and peculiar background – as when some student asks, “Where did you get all this?” Well, you just picked up a thing or two in Turkestan, or “I’m quite a bit older than I look,” or say that “Reincarnation is entirely unlike what people suppose it to be.” Later, let on that you are in some way connected with an extremely select in-group. Don’t brashly claim anything. Your students will soon do that for you, and, when one hits on the fantasy that pleases you most, say, “I see you are just touching stage eighteen.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two schools of thought about asking for money for your services. One is to have fees just like a doctor, because people are embarrassed if they do not know just what is expected of them. The other, used by the real high-powered tricksters, is to do everything free with, however, the understanding that each student has been personally selected for his or her innate capacity for the work (call it that), and thus be careful not to admit anyone without first putting them through some sort of hazing. Monetary contributions will soon be offered. Otherwise, charge rather heavily, making it dear that the work is worth infinitely more to oneself and to others than, say, expensive surgery or a new home. Imply that you give most of it away to mysterious beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as you can afford to wangle it, get hold of a country house as an ashram or spiritual retreat, and put students to work on all the menial tasks. Insist on some special diet, but do not follow it yourself. Indeed, you should cultivate small vices, such as smoking, mild boozing, or, if you are very careful, sleeping with the ladies, to suggest that your stage of evolution is so high that such things do not affect you, or that only by such means can you remain in contact with ordinary mundane consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, you yourself must be utterly free from any form of religious or parapsychological superstition, lest some other trickster should outplay you. On the other hand, you must eventually come to believe in your own hoax, because this will give you ten times more nerve. This can be done through religionizing total skepticism to the point of basic incredulity about everything – even science. After all, this is in line with the Hindu-Buddhist position that the whole universe is an illusion, and you need not worry about whether the Absolute is real or unreal, eternal or non-eternal, because every idea of it that you could form would, in comparison with living it up in the present, be horribly boring. Furthermore, you should convince yourself that the Absolute is precisely the same as illusion, and thus not be in the least ashamed of being greedy or anxious or depressed. Make it dear that we are ultimately God, but that you know it. If you are challenged to perform wonders, point out that everything is already a fabulous wonder, and to do something bizarre would be to go against your own most perfect scheme of things. On the other hand, when funny coincidences turn up, look knowing and show no surprise, especially when any student has good fortune or recovers from sickness. It will promptly be attributed to your powers, and you may be astonished to find that your very touch becomes healing, because people really believe in you. When it doesn’t work, you should sigh gently about lack of faith, or explain that this particular sickness is a very important working out of Karma which will have to be reckoned with some day, so why not now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reputation for supernormal powers is self-reinforcing, and as it builds up you can get more daring, such that you will have the whole power of mass self-deception working for you. But always remember that a good guru plays it cool and maintains a certain aloofness, especially from those sharpies of the press and TV whose game is to expose just about everyone as a fraud. Always insist, like the finest restaurants, that your clientele is exclusive. The very highest “society” does not deign to be listed in the Social Register.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As time goes on, allow it more and more to be understood that you are in constant touch with other centers of work. Disappear from time to time by taking trips abroad, and come back looking more mysterious than ever. You can easily find someone in India or Syria to do duty as your colleague, and take a small and select group of students on a journey which includes a brief interview with this Personage. He can talk any kind of nonsense, while you do the “translating.” When travelling with students, avoid any obvious assistance from regular agencies, and let it appear that your secret fraternity has arranged everything in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now a trickster guru is certainly an illusionist, but one might ask “What else is art?” If the universe is nothing but a vast Rorschach blot upon which we project our collective measures and interpretations, and if past and future has no real existence, an illusionist is simply a creative artist who changes the collective interpretation of life, and even improves on it. Reality is mostly what a people or a culture conceives it to be. Money, worthless in itself, depends entirely on collective faith for its value. The past is held against you only because others believe in it, and the future seems important only because we have conned ourselves into the notion that surviving for a long time, with painstaking care, is preferable to surviving for a short time with no responsibility and lots of thrills. It is really a matter of changing fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, then, a trickster may be one who actually liberates people from their more masochistic participations in the collective illusion, on the homeopathic principle of “The hair of the dog that bit you. ” Even genuine gurus set their disciples impossible psychological exercises to demonstrate the unreality of the ego, and it could be argued that they too, are unwitting tricksters, raised as they have been in cultures without disillusioning benefits of “scientific knowledge,” which, as ecologists note, isn’t working out too well. Perhaps it all boils down to the ancient belief that God himself is a trickster, eternally fooling himself by the power of maya into the sensation that he is a human being, a cat, or an insect, since no art can be accomplished which does not set itself certain rules and limitations. A fully infinite and boundless God would have no limitations, and thus no way of manifesting power or love. Omnipotence must therefore include the power of self-restriction – to the point of forgetting that it is restricting itself and thus making limitations seem real. It could be that genuine students and gurus are on the side of being fooled, whereas the phony gurus are the foolers – and one must make one’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am proposing this problem as a kind of Zen koan, like “Beyond positive and negative, what is reality?” How will you avoid being either a fool or a fooler? How will you get rid of the ego-illusion without either trying or not trying? If you need God’s grace to be saved, how will you get the grace to get grace? Who will answer these questions if yourself is itself an illusion? Man’s extremity is God’s opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cock crows in the evening;\nAt midnight, the brilliant sun.\nAnd there have also been such effective mother-magicians as Mary Baker Eddy, Helena Blavatsky, Aimee Semple McPherson, Annie Besant, and Alice Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;© Alan Watts (1915 – 1973) The Essential Alan Watts, Celestial Arts (1974).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the mind who found this passage (me), checkout my youtube channel where I v-log about similar ideas to Watts: &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/GoldJacketLuke\"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/user/GoldJacketLuke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"The Trickster Guru\n\nby Alan Watts\n\nI have often thought of writing a novel, similar to Thomas Mann’s “Confessions of Felix Krull,” which would be the life story of a charlatan making out as a master guru – either initiated in Tibet or appearing as the reincarnation of Nagarjuna, Padmasambhava, or some other great historical sage of the Orient. It would be a romantic and glamorous tale, flavored with the scent of pines in Himalayan valleys, with garden courtyards in obscure parts of Alexandria, with mountain temples in Japan, and with secretive meetings and initiations in country houses adjoining Paris, New York, and Los Angeles. It would also raise some rather unexpected philosophical questions as to the relations between genuine mysticism and stage magic. But I have neither the patience nor the skill to be a novelist, and thus can do no more than sketch the idea for some more gifted author.\n\nThe attractions of being a trickster guru are many. There is power and there is wealth, and still more the satisfactions of being an actor without need for a stage, who turns “real life” into a drama. It is not, furthermore, an illegal undertaking such as selling shares in non-existent corporations, impersonating a doctor, or falsifying checks. There are no recognized and official qualifications for being a guru, though now that some universities are offering courses in meditation and Kundalini Yoga it may soon be necessary to be a member of the U.S. Fraternity of Gurus. But a really fine trickster would get around all that by the one-upmanship of inventing an entirely new discipline outside and beyond all known forms of esoteric teaching.\n\nIt must be understood from the start that the trickster guru fills a real need and performs a genuine public service. Millions of people are searching desperately for a true father-Magician, especially at a time when the clergy and the psychiatrists are making rather a poor show, and do not seem to have the courage of their convictions or of their fantasies. Perhaps they have lost nerve through too high a valuation of the virtue of honesty – as if a painter felt bound to give his landscapes the fidelity of photographs. To fulfil his compassionate vocation, the trickster guru must above all have nerve. He must also be quite well-read in mystical and occult literature, both that which is historically authentic and sound in scholarship, and that which is somewhat questionable – such as the writings of H.P. Blavatsky, P.D. Ouspensky, and Aleister Crowley. It doesn’t do to be caught out on details now known to a wide public.\n\nAfter such preparatory studies, the first step is to frequent those circles where gurus are especially sought, such as the various cult groups which pursue oriental religions or peculiar forms of psychotherapy, or simply the intellectual and artistic milieux of any great city. Be somewhat quiet and solitary. Never ask questions, but occasionally add a point – quite briefly – to what some speaker has said. Volunteer no information about your personal life, but occasionally indulge in a little absent-minded name-dropping to suggest that you have travelled widely and spent time in Turkestan. Evade close questioning by giving the impression that mere travel is a small matter hardly worth discussing, and that your real interests lie on much deeper levels.\n\nSuch behavior will soon provoke people into asking your advice. Don’t come right out with it, but suggest that the question is rather deep and ought to be discussed at length in some quiet place. Make an appointment at a congenial restaurant or cafe – not at your home, unless you have an impressive library and no evidence of being tied down with a family.

Six years ago my parents divorced and my dad embarked on a series of poor decisions that have left him hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, with one home in foreclosure and another on the way. Most of these decisions have been made under the influence of his fiancee. At 30 years old she&amp;#39;s half his age and only a few years older than my oldest sibling. They&amp;#39;ve been together for 5 years and are technically engaged, but with no wedding plans. She&amp;#39;s also a drug addict, and had a really nasty cocaine and heroin problem in her youth. She was sober when they first met, but due to chronic illness and injury (that may or may not even be real- a case of Munchausen&amp;#39;s Syndrome, I suspect) she&amp;#39;s been dependent on a slew of pain meds, and recently has gained scripts for klonopin and adderall, which she overuses. The only income she has is her disability money, and since she has a shopping addiction as well, its unlikely much of it goes toward household expenses. She&amp;#39;s also constantly in and out of the doctors office and has been through a slew of doctors, surgeries, therapies, and prescriptions over the years. My dad has never been super responsible or great with money, always enjoyed the finer things, and also hasn&amp;#39;t had a steady job in a decade since the economy fell off. He spends more than he can afford to maintain the expensive lifestyle she enjoys so that she won&amp;#39;t leave him. I gave her the benefit of the doubt at first, but she&amp;#39;s clearly just a gold digger. It&amp;#39;s hard for me and my siblings to deal with his issues and even harder for him, so we don&amp;#39;t talk about his money or his fiancee much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now its unavoidable. His fiancee totaled his car last night, which was a leased car he could barely afford the payments on. Luckily no one was injured but she ploughed through a median and did some serious damage to public property. She was also charged with some crimes because there was a crackpipe in the car and she was driving under the influence. She had to be sedated because she was resisting the cops, so she hasn&amp;#39;t been able to explain herself, but she was clearly with someone else, probably another man, who must have bailed on the scene because some unexplainable objects like baby clothes and toys were also found in the car. My dad recently suffered an emotional breakdown over the holidays due to financial pressure and trouble with his girlfriend, I am terrified of what the impact of this crisis might be. If he takes financial responsibility for her legal fees, hospital bills, the damage done to the median, and his car, he will be ruined. If he continues to be in relationship with a cheating gold digging junkie whore, things will only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He does have a steady contract gig that pays decently. He has a house that&amp;#39;s not worth much but he can get rid of the majority of his debt by selling it. My mother is willing to offer him support and an extra room until he gets himself back on his feet, but she&amp;#39;s getting frustrated with him lately. He&amp;#39;s 60 and doesn&amp;#39;t have much time to rebuild his finances so he needs to make a decision quickly. But he&amp;#39;s so depressed, desperate, and despondent that he can&amp;#39;t bring himself to take the major steps to break up with his girlfriend, sell his house, and return to my mom&amp;#39;s house with his tail between his legs. I fear his plan is eventually suicide when his current home gets foreclosed on and shit really hits the fan. He&amp;#39;s so sensitive right now that I&amp;#39;m terrified to push him too hard, but gentle persuasion is not working. My sister wants to host an intervention and forcibly remove his fiancee from the house and ship back to her family, but I worry it will just alienate him further. There&amp;#39;s not much either of us can do for him, since we are both in college across the state. It&amp;#39;s heartbreaking to see him, he&amp;#39;s truly broken and doesn&amp;#39;t have the strength to do what&amp;#39;s best for himself, he just wants to bury his head in the sand and do nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can my family do to get rid of this woman, repair my dad&amp;#39;s self esteem, and encourage him to fix his life before it&amp;#39;s really too late?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"To say my dad is in a mid life crisis is an understatement. Six years ago my parents divorced and my dad embarked on a series of poor decisions that have left him hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, with one home in foreclosure and another on the way. Most of these decisions have been made under the influence of his fiancee. At 30 years old she's half his age and only a few years older than my oldest sibling. They've been together for 5 years and are technically engaged, but with no wedding plans. She's also a drug addict, and had a really nasty cocaine and heroin problem in her youth. She was sober when they first met, but due to chronic illness and injury (that may or may not even be real- a case of Munchausen's Syndrome, I suspect) she's been dependent on a slew of pain meds, and recently has gained scripts for klonopin and adderall, which she overuses. The only income she has is her disability money, and since she has a shopping addiction as well, its unlikely much of it goes toward household expenses. She's also constantly in and out of the doctors office and has been through a slew of doctors, surgeries, therapies, and prescriptions over the years. My dad has never been super responsible or great with money, always enjoyed the finer things, and also hasn't had a steady job in a decade since the economy fell off. He spends more than he can afford to maintain the expensive lifestyle she enjoys so that she won't leave him. I gave her the benefit of the doubt at first, but she's clearly just a gold digger. It's hard for me and my siblings to deal with his issues and even harder for him, so we don't talk about his money or his fiancee much. \n\nBut now its unavoidable. His fiancee totaled his car last night, which was a leased car he could barely afford the payments on. Luckily no one was injured but she ploughed through a median and did some serious damage to public property. She was also charged with some crimes because there was a crackpipe in the car and she was driving under the influence. She had to be sedated because she was resisting the cops, so she hasn't been able to explain herself, but she was clearly with someone else, probably another man, who must have bailed on the scene because some unexplainable objects like baby clothes and toys were also found in the car. My dad recently suffered an emotional breakdown over the holidays due to financial pressure and trouble with his girlfriend, I am terrified of what the impact of this crisis might be. If he takes financial responsibility for her legal fees, hospital bills, the damage done to the median, and his car, he will be ruined. If he continues to be in relationship with a cheating gold digging junkie whore, things will only get worse.\n\nHe does have a steady contract gig that pays decently. He has a house that's not worth much but he can get rid of the majority of his debt by selling it. My mother is willing to offer him support and an extra room until he gets himself back on his feet, but she's getting frustrated with him lately. He's 60 and doesn't have much time to rebuild his finances so he needs to make a decision quickly. But he's so depressed, desperate, and despondent that he can't bring himself to take the major steps to break up with his girlfriend, sell his house, and return to my mom's house with his tail between his legs. I fear his plan is eventually suicide when his current home gets foreclosed on and shit really hits the fan. He's so sensitive right now that I'm terrified to push him too hard, but gentle persuasion is not working. My sister wants to host an intervention and forcibly remove his fiancee from the house and ship back to her family, but I worry it will just alienate him further. There's not much either of us can do for him, since we are both in college across the state. It's heartbreaking to see him, he's truly broken and doesn't have the strength to do what's best for himself, he just wants to bury his head in the sand and do nothing. \n\nWhat can my family do to get rid of this woman, repair my dad's self esteem, and encourage him to fix his life before it's really too late?","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"of1kc","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"throwawayy19","num_comments":3,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/of1kc/my_dads_gold_digging_fiancee_has_left_his_life_in/","name":"t3_of1kc","created":1326430279,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/of1kc/my_dads_gold_digging_fiancee_has_left_his_life_in/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"My dad's gold digging fiancee has left his life in shambles.

The critical resolved shear stress is only 1 MPa. That might not mean much all by itself, so first I&amp;#39;ll quickly explain what the critical resolved shear stress is. Imagine a single crystal of aluminum in the shape of a cylinder. If you were to put a load P on the long axis of the cylinder, the crystal would deform but it WOULDN&amp;#39;T just squish the cylinder to make it fatter. &lt;a href=\"http://mmd.sdsmt.edu/yieldpoint/Image170.gif\"&gt;Diagram of load P&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the cylinder would give out on the slip plane, which is shown as the vector &lt;strong&gt;η&lt;/strong&gt;. That is because that slip plane, &lt;a href=\"http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/slip/images/diagram009.gif\"&gt;shown here&lt;/a&gt; is the weakest plane in that crystal lattice. So if you were to squeeze the top and bottom of the previously shown cube, it would actually deform along the diagonal plane, which is the {111} plane. In Aluminum, it only takes 1 MPa of force to shear the crystal along that plane, compared to the 8 MPa it would take for Mg, or Zn&amp;#39;s shear stress of closer to 4 MPa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when you introduce impurities so the Al is only 99% pure or less, the bulk mechanical properties become much stronger. This is why you can find Al in structural pieces such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.elpasoparagliding.com/Store/PG/MiscAcc/Carabiners/woody-valley-aluminum-carabiner-1_LRG.jpg\"&gt;Al caribiners&lt;/a&gt;. That image is not of a standard rock climbing caribiner, but it can still take a significant load. It&amp;#39;s been a while since I was rock climbing, however I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we used steel caribiners since I remember them being much heavier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take another look at where Al is on the periodic table. It is near the non-metallic elements, and therefore the bonding is somewhat directional. This characteristic makes cross slip easy, which is simply the slip changing from one plane to another. However, like most other FCC metals, this can be changed by work hardening at cold temperatures. After a &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/LyOK2.png\"&gt;75% reduction&lt;/a&gt; during a rolling process, the ultimate tensile strength increases 500% from 27 MPa to 127 MPa. Take a look at that picture, and look at the grain boundaries before and after the rolling process. See how they are flattened and more &amp;quot;textured&amp;quot; in the planar direction? There are more stresses built up in each individual grain, and some of the slip planes are &amp;quot;pinned&amp;quot; because atomic dislocations start crossing each other and tie each other up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We mentioned that high purity Al is soft. Ultra high purity Al will actually recover and recrystallize at room temperature, which means it really can&amp;#39;t be cold worked like in the previous picture (because the grains will slowly form back to their original shape), but commercial quality Al needs higher annealing temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solubility of Gas and Porosity:&lt;/strong&gt; Most gasses have a low solubility and both solid and liquid Al, but Hydrogen (H) is small and reactive enough to be absorbed. This high H solubility in the liquid Al can lead to &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/4gXRa.png\"&gt;gas bubble porosity&lt;/a&gt;, making the Al much weaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aluminum Association Alloy Designation, AKA &amp;quot;XXXX&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is simply a 4 digit code that describes the composition of the alloy. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Y68je.png\"&gt;Here is a quick table for reference&lt;/a&gt;. In the system, the last two or three digits describe the impurity content. So 1050 is unalloyed Al that is 99.50% pure, and the .50% impurities are unintentionally included in the alloy. These impurities are usually Iron (Fe) and Silicon (Si). Fe is largely insoluble in Al, but Si forms a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; phase only when more than 0.25% is present. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ds22p.png\"&gt;This micrograph&lt;/a&gt; shows cold worked and recrystallized aluminum. The black portions of the micrograph are the Al3Fe and Si precipitates. This metal&amp;#39;s conductivity is almost as high as ultra-pure Al. The large precipitates provide minor strengthening; work hardening is the primary strengthening source for this specific alloy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/W3GHW.png\"&gt;Mg in 5XXX alloys&lt;/a&gt; is used as a solid solution hardener in Al. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v9/n9/images_article/nmat2840-f1.jpg\"&gt;This diagram shows how solid solution hardening works&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the larger Mg atoms are forced into the crystal structure of the Al. This places an outward compressive stress on the local Aluminum lattice, and also helps block dislocation motion. The dislocation symbol is that upside down &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; shown to the above left of the red Mg atom. These Mg alloys have moderate strength, decent weldability and decent seawater corrosion resistance. These 5xxx alloys retain work hardening to higher temperatures &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AwjzG.png\"&gt;as shown in this diagram&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they won&amp;#39;t recrystallize and restructure/recover their grain structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/lYVgU.png\"&gt;Mn in 3XXX alloys&lt;/a&gt; is used as a dispersoid former. The Mn and Fe combine to make Al6Mn and Al6Fe intermetallic compounds that block dislocations and inhibit grain growth. Smaller grains means more grain boundaries, and more grain boundaries mean more energy dense areas that make it hard for dislocation and slip to occur in the bulk material. These alloys have comparable strength and corrosion resistant to 5XXX alloys, but are more weldable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Learn How To Precipitate Harden:&lt;/strong&gt; Cu can be added to Al to allow precipitation hardening. This is a quick and easy 3-step process. After learning this, you&amp;#39;ve learned half of what metallurgy is all about! (I make fun of metallurgy being a very simple field, all you have to do is &amp;quot;heat and beat&amp;quot; your metal or mix in other metals to make it stronger. Quite simple. But in reality, it is fairly difficult to get great, new compositions). Okay, so &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/qnUXd.png\"&gt;here is the diagram for precipitation hardening&lt;/a&gt; that we will be using.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start at a high &amp;quot;solutionizing temperature&amp;quot; to form a single phase solid solution of your metals. That means the Cu is evenly distributed in the Al FCC lattice. If this isn&amp;#39;t solutionized, the structure will look like &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/mhOwe.png\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; with a coarse microstructure. This is due to Al2Cu particles, which we need to dissolve at these higher temperatures. Holding it at about 520&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C for an hour will dissolve that phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You quench to a low temperature to freeze all of those Cu atoms in place. Generally the quenching is done in oil or water to rapidly drop the temperature to 20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C or so. The metals cool so quickly that it doesn&amp;#39;t have time to segregate into the equilibrium two-phase microstructure. &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/48rmA.png\"&gt;So now you still have an evenly dispersed Cu solution&lt;/a&gt; in the Al, but now the individual atoms don&amp;#39;t have enough thermal energy to vibrate and move around, forming any compounds. This is considered a metastable phase, similar to diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You then &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; and heat up the metal a small amount to give &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; enough thermal energy to where the atoms can rearrange and form a second phase. This second phase is Al2Cu. If you see the diagram, the phase field we are in is simply Al + Al2Cu. If you hold this temperature for just a little while, a small amount of the Al2Cu will form and you can control how much forms based on the time you leave your sample at this temperature. The longer you leave it at the 3 temperature, the more Al2Cu you will form, which will continually change the properties of the material and strengthen it. These precipitates &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/MYeCt.png\"&gt;place a strain&lt;/a&gt; on the Al lattice and therefore the local energy is increased in this region. The Al is then left at this temperature for an even longer time to form smaller precipitates, which further strengthen the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"**Aluminum Mechanical Properties:** As stated earlier, Al is an FCC metal.

This high H solubility in the liquid Al can lead to [gas bubble porosity](http://i.imgur.com/4gXRa.png), making the Al much weaker.\n\n**Aluminum Association Alloy Designation, AKA \"XXXX\":** This is simply a 4 digit code that describes the composition of the alloy. [Here is a quick table for reference](http://i.imgur.com/Y68je.png). In the system, the last two or three digits describe the impurity content. So 1050 is unalloyed Al that is 99.50% pure, and the .50% impurities are unintentionally included in the alloy. These impurities are usually Iron (Fe) and Silicon (Si). Fe is largely insoluble in Al, but Si forms a 2^nd phase only when more than 0.25% is present. [This micrograph](http://i.imgur.com/Ds22p.png) shows cold worked and recrystallized aluminum. The black portions of the micrograph are the Al3Fe and Si precipitates. This metal's conductivity is almost as high as ultra-pure Al. The large precipitates provide minor strengthening; work hardening is the primary strengthening source for this specific alloy.\n\nThe [Mg in 5XXX alloys](http://i.imgur.com/W3GHW.png) is used as a solid solution hardener in Al. [This diagram shows how solid solution hardening works](http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v9/n9/images_article/nmat2840-f1.jpg). You can see the larger Mg atoms are forced into the crystal structure of the Al. This places an outward compressive stress on the local Aluminum lattice, and also helps block dislocation motion. The dislocation symbol is that upside down \"T\" shown to the above left of the red Mg atom. These Mg alloys have moderate strength, decent weldability and decent seawater corrosion resistance. These 5xxx alloys retain work hardening to higher temperatures [as shown in this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/AwjzG.png), meaning they won't recrystallize and restructure/recover their grain structure.\n\nThe [Mn in 3XXX alloys](http://i.imgur.com/lYVgU.png) is used as a dispersoid former. The Mn and Fe combine to make Al6Mn and Al6Fe intermetallic compounds that block dislocations and inhibit grain growth. Smaller grains means more grain boundaries, and more grain boundaries mean more energy dense areas that make it hard for dislocation and slip to occur in the bulk material. These alloys have comparable strength and corrosion resistant to 5XXX alloys, but are more weldable.\n\n**Let's Learn How To Precipitate Harden:** Cu can be added to Al to allow precipitation hardening. This is a quick and easy 3-step process. After learning this, you've learned half of what metallurgy is all about! (I make fun of metallurgy being a very simple field, all you have to do is \"heat and beat\" your metal or mix in other metals to make it stronger. Quite simple. But in reality, it is fairly difficult to get great, new compositions). Okay, so [here is the diagram for precipitation hardening](http://i.imgur.com/qnUXd.png) that we will be using.\n\n1. You start at a high \"solutionizing temperature\" to form a single phase solid solution of your metals. That means the Cu is evenly distributed in the Al FCC lattice. If this isn't solutionized, the structure will look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/mhOwe.png) with a coarse microstructure. This is due to Al2Cu particles, which we need to dissolve at these higher temperatures. Holding it at about 520^o C for an hour will dissolve that phase.\n\n2. You quench to a low temperature to freeze all of those Cu atoms in place. Generally the quenching is done in oil or water to rapidly drop the temperature to 20^o C or so. The metals cool so quickly that it doesn't have time to segregate into the equilibrium two-phase microstructure. [So now you still have an evenly dispersed Cu solution](http://i.imgur.com/48rmA.png) in the Al, but now the individual atoms don't have enough thermal energy to vibrate and move around, forming any compounds. This is considered a metastable phase, similar to diamond.\n\n3. You then \"age\" and heat up the metal a small amount to give *just* enough thermal energy to where the atoms can rearrange and form a second phase. This second phase is Al2Cu. If you see the diagram, the phase field we are in is simply Al + Al2Cu. If you hold this temperature for just a little while, a small amount of the Al2Cu will form and you can control how much forms based on the time you leave your sample at this temperature. The longer you leave it at the 3 temperature, the more Al2Cu you will form, which will continually change the properties of the material and strengthen it. These precipitates [place a strain](http://i.imgur.com/MYeCt.png) on the Al lattice and therefore the local energy is increased in this region. The Al is then left at this temperature for an even longer time to form smaller precipitates, which further strengthen the material.","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"1fq6t2","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"terevos2","num_comments":0,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2xgne","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/periodic_table/comments/1fq6t2/aluminum_gallium_indium_thallium_part_2/","name":"t3_1fq6t2","created":1370451222,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/periodic_table/comments/1fq6t2/aluminum_gallium_indium_thallium_part_2/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"Aluminum, Gallium, Indium, Thallium (Part 2)","created_utc":1370447622,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":false,"threadNum":2,"commentNum":0,"totalResults":3,"label":"negative"},{"question":"What is the opposite of strong?","thread":{"domain":"self.askscience","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"askscience","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If each force has an equivalent opposite force, does gravity have an opposite force?

Good for quick-and-dirty calculations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","subreddit":"askscience","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_c8fuewu","created":1360960627,"author_flair_text":null,"created_utc":1360960627,"ups":1,"mod_reports":[],"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null},"threadNum":6,"commentNum":1,"totalResults":15},{"question":"what is your favorite book","thread":{"domain":"self.AskReddit","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"AskReddit","selftext_html":null,"selftext":"","likes":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"222pin","gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"henhen3000","num_comments":177,"score":73,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"stickied":false,"is_self":true,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/222pin/what_is_your_favorite_book_and_why/","name":"t3_222pin","created":1396500304,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/222pin/what_is_your_favorite_book_and_why/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"What is your favorite book, and why?","created_utc":1396496704,"distinguished":null,"media":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":73},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"link_id":"t3_222pin","likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"cgiwnah","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Organs","parent_id":"t3_222pin","score":11,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Neil Gaiman's *American Gods*.

I feel i should get some credit for what i do, not just getting told several times a month that what i do dont create income to the company.\n- The lead developer (my boss) is not having a good time either, and considering changing jobs.\n\nWhat would you all do Reddit? Ever had any simular experience? Am I just an ass to care about these things in my job?","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":null,"id":"bez3d","from_kind":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"nerdgolfer","media":null,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"num_comments":24,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"removal_reason":null,"stickied":false,"from":null,"is_self":true,"from_id":null,"permalink":"/r/AskReddit/comments/bez3d/when_should_you_leave_a_job/?ref=search_posts","name":"t3_bez3d","created":1268918751,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bez3d/when_should_you_leave_a_job/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"When should you leave a job?","created_utc":1268915151,"distinguished":null,"mod_reports":[],"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"ups":1},"comment":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_bez3d","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_bez3d","likes":null,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","banned_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_bez3d","likes":null,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"c0mfjl8","gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"hiddencorpse","parent_id":"t1_c0mfj3g","score":2,"approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Make sure to do your research.

It was an hour or so before sunset so the waters were pretty busy with people heading back to their slips. Most notably there were two jet skiiers who were rocketing around in our wake, trying to get air. They must have gotten bored of this and decided to pass us. They speed up and there is one on either side of our boat. They were starting to get dangerously close, so My father&amp;#39;s friend (an ex-navy pilot) who is driving, honks the horn a few times and tries to wave them off. No response - either they don&amp;#39;t hear or they don&amp;#39;t care. Just as my father&amp;#39;s friend says he is going to slow down to let these idiots get ahead of us, one of the jet skiiers, who is apparently unaware of the boat&amp;#39;s presence, cuts hard to his right... directly into the path of our boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father&amp;#39;s friend can&amp;#39;t swerve to avoid him without running the other jet skiier over and there is no way he can stop in time to let the jet skier go in front... So he cuts the engine and goes hard to the left knowing it&amp;#39;s better if the idiot hits the the hull instead of the bow. The sound of the engine being cut FINALLY catches the attention of the dude we are about to run over MILLISECONDS before the impact. He has just about enough time to see the boat and them &lt;em&gt;WHAM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is an awful shuddering sound and then thudding all along the bottom of the boat. At this point we had glided to a stop and my mother had ushered all the smaller children into the cabin because we had no idea what this was going to look like. We are all scanning the water when we see the mangled jet ski jump out of the water about 30 feet behind us; a moment later, the jet skiers body does the same. The guy was floating face down, not moving. My mother started screaming, I nearly passed out and my father&amp;#39;s friend was already on the radio for help. But my father? Without hesitation the man dove into the water fully clothed (shoes, wallet, sunglasses - everything) and started swimming toward what appeared to be a dead body and a jet ski now leaking fuel into the water. I start screaming for him to come back - the water we were in was 30 feet deep and there was gas everywhere. I was terrified... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father made it to the body, shook the guy and turned him over. The jet skier&amp;#39;s head lolled. My father then pinched the guys nose and gave him mouth to mouth until he sputtered back in consciousness. Almost immediately, the jet skier started flailing in panic (probably having a delayed reaction to having seen a boat about to run him over). That&amp;#39;s when he pushed my father underwater. My father got away and swam back up - they were pretty far away but I heard him yell something along the lines of &amp;quot;I will hit you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t make me hit you&amp;quot; and the jet skier calmed down a little... Until he saw the tangle of metal that was once his jet ski, that is... The jet skier (who we found out later had shattered his collar bone and most of the bones in right arm AND leg) started trying to swim toward the jet ski.

That&amp;#39;s when my father grabbed the guy by the life jacket and dragged him away from the wreckage. Once they got a few feet out he held onto the guy with one hand and took off the shirt he was wearing with the other - meanwhile the jet ski idiot was so delirious from the accident that he STILL kept trying to swim back to the jet ski. My father then proceeded to tie the delirious idiot&amp;#39;s arms to his sides and drag him back to our boat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Dad is pretty &amp;#39;effin tough. :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"A few years ago my family and some friends and I were heading home on our boat after having spent the day anchored in a popular swimming cove.

A 24-hour marathon stream to celebrate the launch of our live stream channel on Twitch. We pulled it off. Now check out the recap below to see just what we learned. It’s a lot to digest sure, but a must read for anyone interested in the world of live streaming video games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical difficulties are terrifying, inevitable, but manageable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working with technology is often an exponential risk. For every layer of devices or software you add to a project your chances of running into errors multiplies at an exponential rate. Streaming is a prime example of this. For our marathon setup we were using a Wii U, external capture card, webcam, microphone, streaming software, chatbot/dashboard, not to mention the network connection itself. That is a lot of layers to have working in sync, and if one isn’t working then the whole production can quickly fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That nearly happened just one hour into our marathon. I was getting some mic feedback and decided to take a quick timeout to make the proper adjustments to fix the problem. 15-30 minutes of non-action is worth it if it’s to save a 24-hour stream right? Apparently my laptop didn’t think so. After changing one setting within the Elgato capture card’s settings my laptop immediately ceased to recognize any device I had plugged into it via USB. What was supposed to be a quick fix turned into an hour or so long ordeal. It was even enough that I considered dropping the marathon all together.I eventually fixed the issue and got the stream running at an optimal state, but the emotional roller coaster I experienced to get to that point was harrowing to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the experience, every issue the stream had (outside of the laptop dropping the devices) was something that could have and should have been dealt with before the stream even started. Had I just taken the time prior to starting up OBS to hammer out the little details things would have gone far more smoothly. I find myself looking at technology much as I look at weather, you can never fully predict what might happen, but you can certainly do your best to prepare for it. By doing that you save yourself a lot of potential grief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staging cooking demos is hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to go big or go home with our first time streaming and cooking, which was a bit of a rookie mistake.  We planned out our recipes and went grocery shopping the night before to get prepped.  The idea was that Anthony would start the stream, and when I got home from work we’d jump into the cooking.  Well, by the time I got off work and picked up Kirby my hungry husband had been streaming for over seven hours uninterrupted, so I hit the kitchen and started working on queso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal was to put the webcam on me at some point, but in the interest of time and nourishment we just jumped straight into it and gorged ourselves on queso and guacamole.  As it got later and later into the night, it was harder to stay motivated and want to tear the kitchen back up just for a bit to eat.  In the end we snacked on what we had and cut our losses.  Next time I would scale back on recipes (we went for 8 and managed to make 5) and do more pre-work ahead of time to cut down on amount of time spent in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing games (well) and interacting with viewers is also hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While studying up on how to properly run a stream, two of the chief recommendations were to interact with your viewers, and to play games you are reasonably skilled at playing. After streaming in front of an active chat room I can see why. It’s not easy to find a balance between interaction and gameplay. Focus on the game and you run the risk of ignoring the very reason you’re broadcasting in the first place. Get too social and your gameplay quality quickly begins to suffer. The easiest fixes to this problem? Either play a game you’re so good at that a few distractions don’t hurt your overall game, or try to play games with enough natural breaks that you can breathe every few minutes to have some fun with your viewers. For our marathon I found Wind Waker to be the most accessible for chatting, but the least entertaining, while Mario Kart and Smash were the exact opposite. Kirby: Canvas Curse and Super Mario World 3D seemed to be the sweet middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlays could be my favorite part of streaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much to say outside of the headline for this one. There’s something incredibly satisfying about creating the various parts of our broadcast’s overlay images. Sure, it’s still rough around the edges in a lot of ways, but seeing your work displayed to the world in one cohesive theme really ties the whole experience together. Even more so when you’re updating it live like we did with the hourly updates as you see in the lower righthand corner of the screenshot above. Setting up a live streaming channel can be grueling and technical, but if there’s one part I am more than willing to drop hours on it is the overlay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Zone” can be a dangerous place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a thought for live streaming, it’s for gaming in general. It is all too easy to slip into a groove while playing games. When in this groove a sort of tunnel vision takes hold and it can be far too easy to find yourself snapping too several hours later hungry and dehydrated. Aspen and I found this happening on occasion Friday night and we even had several snacks planned to share. We didn’t eat dinner until 1 AM, not so much by choice, but by coincidence. Remember kids, replenish those bodily resources when you’re gaming, ESPECIALLY if you’re taking part in a marathon session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variety is the key to surviving a marathon stream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, I love Nintendo games. Effing. Love’em. That said, I nearly got diabetes from playing those sugary sweet games for 24 hours straight this weekend. After a while they all started to blend together into some sick amalgamation of bright colors and innocent sounds. Not that it wasn’t fun. It was a blast, but the marathon itself would have been far easier to stomach if I had sprinkled a few choice shooters or hack-and-slash games in for flavor. Hell, even playing other platformers on PC would have helped. Alas, we didn’t have our stream setup for such a thing this time around, but the next time around I’ll be sure to keep this little observation in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really need to learn more about Twitch and streaming culture in general.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, prior to setting up our own stream I had very little exposure to the Twitch community as a whole. I watched a few of the larger events sure, particularly “Twitch Plays Pokemon,” but for the most part Aspen and I went into creating our channel with very little knowledge of what to expect from the experience. This came back to bite me a bit on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At around 3 in the morning I was playing Mario Kart with absolutely zero viewers to be found in our channel. In the middle of a race I took a glance at the viewer count to find 350 people. Our chatroom was getting spammed to Hell and back and I honestly wasn’t sure what to do. Given that it’s the internet, I assumed the worst of the situation and that our guests were trolls looking to do some late night harassing before moving on to the next hapless channel. I ignored them and played on, assuming the “trolls” would get bored and leave. In fact, the viewers actually came from another streamer’s channel who had stumbled upon Games and Grinds and told his viewers to take part in an innocent raid to say hi. After the majority of the viewers had cleared out, a few others hung back to explain the situation. Apparently it’s just a Twitch thing that happens every now and then. They didn’t mean anything aggressive by it and my previous assumptions were totally off-base. We chatted for a while and they gave me a few tips for the channel before moving on. So yeah, I definitely need to spend some time on other channels and get more acquainted with Twitch and the community. Of course, with my luck the next group of viewers to raid the channel actually will be a bunch of assholes that I welcome with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At its best, streaming is incredibly fun and exactly what I hoped it would be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a grueling 24 hours, but it was absolutely worth it. I had a great time streaming and interacting with new viewers on Twitch. Sure, there were times that I wondered why I was putting myself through it, but closing out the channel at noon on Saturday left me feeling inspired to try plenty of new ways to stream. I initially wanted to start a channel to reconnect with gaming and experience it in a new way, and I certainly got a taste of that with this marathon. I’ve gone ahead and ordered new parts for a gaming pc, a big step toward opening up the potential of the Games &amp;amp; Grinds Twitch channel.
