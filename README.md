This code isn't great. I intend to rewrite it someday. I've learned a lot since I started this.

Currently it would be difficult to set this up yourself, because it requires the existence of a dataset which is kind of big to upload right now. The dataset is how the machine learning learns what responses are good and what are bad. I will try to fix this later.
