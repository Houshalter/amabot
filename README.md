# amabot
An IRC bot that answers questions by searching reddit.

This code isn't great. I intend to rewrite it someday. I've learned a lot since I started this.

~~Currently it would be difficult to set this up yourself, because it requires the existence of a dataset which is kind of big to upload right now. The dataset is how the machine learning learns what responses are good and what are bad. I will try to fix this later.~~

Hopefully it works. You will need node and to navigate to the folder you saved it in.

Again, this code was never meant to be shared and I'd like to redo it someday. Sorry for any and all issues. I'm very happy that people are interested in my project.

See the config variables at the top of the amabot.js file to configure it.
